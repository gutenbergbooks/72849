<small>THE WOMAN ... WHOSE HANDS ARE AS BANDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lights of Silverette were beginning to prick the
dusk in the valley, and the clanging of a piano, diminished
to a harmonious tinkling, floated up the
mountain on the still air of the evening. At the Jessica
workings, a thousand feet above the valley, even the
clangour of a tuneless piano had its compensations;
and to one of the two men sitting on the puncheon-floored
porch of the assayer’s cabin the minimized tinkling
was remindful of care-free student ramblings in
the land of the zither. But the other had no such
pleasant memories, and he rose and relighted his cigar.</p>

<p>“That is my cue, Ned. I must go down and do
that whereunto I have set my hand.”</p>

<p>“‘Must,’ you say; that implies necessity. I don’t
see it.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t expect you to see or to understand the
necessity; but it is there, all the same.”</p>

<p>The objector was silent while one might count ten,
but the silence was not of convincement. It was rather
a lack of strong words to add to those which had gone
before. And when he began again it was only to clinch
insistence with iteration.</p>

<p>“I say I don’t see it. There is no necessity greater
than a man’s will; and when you try to make me believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
that the honour man of my class is constrained to come
down to dealing faro in a mining camp——”</p>

<p>“I know, Ned; but you don’t understand. You
saw the fair beginning ten years ago, and now you are
getting a glimpse of the ending. To you, I suppose, it
seems like Lucifer’s fall—a drop from heaven to hell;
and so it is in effect. But, as a matter of fact, a man
doesn’t fall; he climbs down into the pit a step at a
time—and there are more steps behind me than I can
ever retrace.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t go on indefinitely,” insisted the
other.</p>

<p>The fallen one shook his head. “That is a true
word. But there is only one adequate ending to such
a fiasco of a life as mine.”</p>

<p>“And that?”</p>

<p>“Is a forty-five calibre bullet, well aimed.”</p>

<p>“Bah! That is a coward’s alternative, and if you
haven’t altogether parted company with the George
Brant I used to know, we needn’t consider it. Why
don’t you turn over a clean leaf and cut the whole despicable
business?”</p>

<p>Brant sat down on the porch step and clasped his
hands over his knee. Friendship has its key wherewith
to unlock any door of confidence, but from disuse the
lock was rusted and it yielded reluctantly.</p>

<p>“I have half a mind to let the game wait while I
tell you,” he said at length. “It isn’t a pleasant tale,
and if you are disgusted you can call me down.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that; go on.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go back a bit first—back to the old
college days. Do you remember the old woman who
lived on the flat below the campus? the one who used to
smuggle liquor and other contraband into the dormitories
when she came to scrub?”</p>

<p>“Mother Harding? Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“Well, you don’t remember any good of her, I fancy—or
of her daughter. But let that pass. The year
after you went to Heidelberg the girl blossomed out
into a woman between two days, and went wrong the
day after, as the daughter of such a mother was bound
to. I got it into my callow brain that I was responsible.
I know better now; I ought to have known better then;
but—well, to shorten a long story, she has managed to
spoil my life for me, root and branch.”</p>

<p>The assayer got upon his feet and swore out of a full
heart.</p>

<p>“Good God, Brant! You don’t mean to say that
you married that brazen——”</p>

<p>But Brant stopped him with a quick gesture.
“Don’t call her hard names, Ned; I shot a man once
for doing that. No, I didn’t marry her; I did a worse
thing. Now you know why I can’t turn the clean leaf.
Let the blame lie where it will—and it is pretty evenly
divided between us now—I’m not cur enough to turn
my back on her at this stage of the game.”</p>

<p>Hobart tramped up and down the slab-floored porch,
four strides and a turn, for two full minutes before he
could frame the final question.</p>

<p>“Where is she now, George?”</p>

<p>Brant’s laugh was of hardihood. “Do you hear
that piano going down there in Dick Gaynard’s dance
hall? She is playing it.”</p>

<p>“Heavens and earth! Then she is here—in Silverette?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Where else would she be?”</p>

<p>Hobart stopped short and flung the stump of his
cigar far out down the slope.</p>

<p>“Brant,” he said solemnly, “I thank God your
mother is dead.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said Brant softly.</p>

<p>There was another pause, and then Hobart spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
again. “There was a brother, George; what became
of him?”</p>

<p>“He went to the bad, too—the worst kind of bad.
He laid hold of the situation in the earliest stages, and
bled me like a leech year in and year out, until one day
I got him at a disadvantage and choked him off.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage it?”</p>

<p>“It was easy enough. He is an outlaw of the camps,
and he has killed his man now and then when it seemed
perfectly safe to do so. But the last time he slipped
a cog in the safety wheel, and I took the trouble to get
the evidence in shape to hang him. He knows I have
it, and he’d sell his soul, if he had one, to get his fingers
on the documents. In the meantime he lets me
alone.”</p>

<p>“He will murder you some day for safety’s sake,”
Hobart suggested.</p>

<p>“No, he won’t. I have made him believe that his
life hangs on mine; that when I die the dogs of the law
will be let loose.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The assayer made another turn or two and
then came to sit on the step beside his guest. “One
more question, George, and then I’ll let up on you,”
he said. “Do you love the woman?”</p>

<p>Brant shook his head slowly. “No, Ned; I never
did; at least, not in the way you mean. And for years
now it has been a matter of simple justice. She was bad
enough in the beginning, but she is worse now, and that
is my doing. I can’t leave her to go down into the hotter
parts of the pit alone.”</p>

<p>For a few other minutes neither of them spoke; then
Brant rose and girded himself for the tramp down the
mountain.</p>

<p>“I must be going,” he said. “I’m glad to have
had an hour with you; it has given me a glimpse of the
old life that is like the shadow of a great rock in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
thirsty land. And I want to see more of you, if you will
let me.”</p>

<p>“It will be your own fault if you don’t. Have you
got to go now?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There is a tough crowd up from Carbonado,
and Gaynard will have his hands full to-night.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute till I get my overcoat, and I’ll go
with you.”</p>

<p>Brant waited, but when Hobart reappeared he made
difficulties.</p>

<p>“You’d better stay where you are, Ned. It’s likely
there will be trouble and a free fight; and you are new
to the place.”</p>

<p>“New to Silverette, but not to mining camps and
rough crowds,” Hobart amended.</p>

<p>Brant still hesitated. “I know, but there is always
the risk—the bystander’s risk, which is usually bigger
than that of the fellow with his gun out. Besides, you
have a wife——”</p>

<p>Hobart pushed him into the downward path.</p>

<p>“You don’t know Kate,” he objected. “She would
drive me to it if she were here and knew the circumstances.
She knows the camps better than either
of us.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later they entered Dick Gaynard’s
dance hall together, and the assayer loitered in the
barroom while Brant edged his way back to the alcove
in the rear, where stood the faro table. Presently Hobart
saw the dealer rise and give his chair to Brant;
then the loiterer felt free to look about him.</p>

<p>There was nothing new or redeeming in the scene.
There was the typical perspiring crowd of rough men
and tawdry women surging to and fro, pounding the
dusty floor to the time beaten out of the discordant
piano; the same flaring oil lamps and murky atmosphere
thick with tobacco smoke and reeking with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
fumes of alcohol; the same silent groups ringing the
roulette boards and the faro table. Hobart looked on,
and was conscious of a little shiver of disgust—a vicarious
thrill of shame for all concerned, but chiefly for his
friend. And Brant had come to this for his daily bread!
Brant, the honour man, the athlete, the well-beloved of
all who knew him!</p>

<p>Hobart let himself drift with the ebb and flow of
those who, like himself, were as yet only onlookers, coming
to anchor when he had found a vantage point from
which he could see and study the face of the fallen
one. For all the hardening years it was not yet an evil
face. The cheeks of the man were thinner and browner
than those of the boy, and the heavy mustache hid the
mouth, the feature which changes most with the changing
years; but the resolute jaw was the same, and the
steady gray eyes, though these had caught the gambler’s
trick of looking out through half-closed lids when they
saw most. On the whole the promise of youth had been
kept. The handsome boy had come to be a man good
to look upon; a man upon whom any woman might look
once, and turning, look again. The assayer was not
given to profanity, but he swore softly in an upflash of
angry grief at the thought that the passing years had
marred Brant’s soul rather than his body.</p>

<p>None the less, it was shipwreck, hopeless and unrelieved,
as Brant had asserted; and from contemplating
the effect of it in the man, Hobart was moved to look
upon the cause of it in the woman. Perhaps there was
that in her which might make the descent into the pit
less unaccountable. Hobart would see.</p>

<p>He worked his way slowly around two sides of the
crowded room, and so came to the piano. One glance at
the performer was enough. It revealed a woman who
had once been beautiful, as the sons of God once found
the daughters of men; nay, the wreck of her was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
beautiful, but it was the soulless beauty whose appeal is
to that which is least worthy in any man. Hobart saw
and understood. There be drunkards a-many who look
not upon the wine when it is red in the cup; and Brant
was of these—an inebriate of passion. The assayer
turned his back upon the woman that he might the better
make excuses for his friend.</p>

<p>Gaynard’s bar did a thriving business that night,
and the throng in the gambling alcove thinned out early.
The dance hall was the greater attraction, and here the
din and clamour grew apace until the raucous voice of
the caller shouting the figures of the dance could no
longer be heard above the clanging of the piano, the
yells and catcalls, and the shuffling and pounding of
feet on the floor. Hilarity was as yet the keynote of all
the uproar, but Hobart knew that the ceaseless activity
of the bartenders must shortly change the pitch to the
key quarrelsome, and he began to wish himself well out
of it.</p>

<p>Brant glanced up from time to time, always without
pause in the monotonous running of the cards, and
when he finally succeeded in catching Hobart’s eye he
beckoned with a nod. The assayer made his way
around to the dealer’s chair, and Brant spoke without
looking up:</p>

<p>“Get out of here, Ned, while you can. There will
be the devil to pay before midnight, and there is no
earthly use in your being mixed up in it.”</p>

<p>Hobart leaned over the table and placed a coin on
one of the inlaid cards to keep up appearances.</p>

<p>“I’m here with you, and I mean to stay,” he insisted.
“You may need— By Jove! it’s begun.”</p>

<p>The dance stopped and the clamour sank into a
hush, which was sharply rent by a blast of profanity, a
jangling crash of the piano keys, and a woman’s scream.
Then the two fought their way into the thick of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
crowd around the piano. A drunken ruffian was grasping
the woman’s arm and brandishing a revolver over
her head.</p>

<p>“You won’t play it, won’t ye? And ye’ll give Ike
Gasset a piece of yer lip? By God, I’ll show ye!”</p>

<p>Brant’s pistol was out before he spoke. “Drop it
right where you are, and get out of here before I kill
you,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>The man’s reply was a snap shot in Brant’s face, and,
though his aim was bad, both Hobart and Brant felt the
wind of the bullet passing between them. The crack
of the pistol was the signal for a scene a description of
which no man has ever yet been able to set down calmly
in black on white. Shouts, oaths, a mad rush for the
open air foiled by a fiercer closing in of the crowd
around the piano; all this while the ruffian levelled his
weapon and fired again. At the death-speeding instant
the woman started to her feet, and the bullet intended
for Brant struck her fairly in the breast. Hobart
heard the sharp snap of the steel corset stay, and
saw Brant, catching her as she reeled, fire once, twice,
thrice at the desperado. Then the assayer lifted up his
voice in a shout that dominated the tumult:</p>

<p>“Silverettes! Out with them—they’ve killed a
woman!”</p>

<p>There was a fierce affray, a surging charge, and when
the place was cleared Hobart ran back. Brant was on
his knees beside the woman. The smoking oil lamps
burned yellow in the powder reek, but there was light
enough to show that she was past help. None the less,
Hobart offered to go for a doctor.</p>

<p>Brant shook his head and rose stiffly.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t need one; she is dead.”</p>

<p>Hobart grasped the situation with far-seeing prescience.</p>

<p>“Then you have nothing to stay here for; let us get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
out while we can.” The din of the street battle rang
clamorous at the front, and he took Brant’s arm to lead
him to the door, which opened upon the alley in the
rear. “Come on,” he urged; “they will be back here
presently, and you have nothing to fight for now.”</p>

<p>“No.” Brant yielded as one in a trance, but at
the door he broke away, to dart back with the gray eyes
aflame and fierce wrath crying for vengeance. Unnoted
of all, the wounded desperado had lain where
Brant’s fusillade had dropped him. But now he was on
hands and knees, trying to drag himself out of the
room. Brant was quick, but the assayer pinioned him
before the ready weapon could flash from its holster.</p>

<p>“Good God, man, that would be murder!” he
panted, wrestling with the avenger of blood, and possessing
himself of the pistol. “Come on out of this!”</p>

<p>Again Brant yielded, and they made their way to
the open air, and through the alleyway to the mountain
path, and so in silence up to the Jessica and to the assayer’s
cabin. Not until they were safe within the four
log walls did Hobart open his mouth. But when he
had struck a light and hung a blanket over the window
which looked valleyward he spoke tersely and to the
point:</p>

<p>“A few hours ago, George, you told me why you
couldn’t turn your back on your shame, and I had nothing
to say. But now the reason is removed, and you
have had an object lesson which ought to last you as
long as you live. What do you say?”</p>

<p>Brant spread his hands as one helpless. “What else
am I good for?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That question is unworthy of you, and you know
it. You have your profession; but without that you
could still do as well as another.”</p>

<p>Brant was still afoot, and he fought his battle to a
finish, pacing slowly back and forth with his hands behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
him and his head bowed. For all his square jaw
and steadfast eyes, rash impulse had been the bane of
his life thus far, and the knowledge of it made him slow
to decide even when the decision leaned toward the
things which make for righteousness. So he fought the
battle to its conclusion, and when it was ended was fain
to sit down awearied with the stress of it.</p>

<p>“I am not in love with the degradation of it; I
think you must know that, Ned. All these years I’ve
had a yearning for decency and clean living and respectability
that I could not strangle, do what I would.
So you will understand that I am not halting between
two opinions. It is simply this: Can a man turn over a
new leaf and bury such a past as mine without being beset
by a constant fear of its resurrection? Won’t it
come up and slap him in the face about the time he
thinks he has it decently buried and covered up and
out of sight?”</p>

<p>Hobart’s rejoinder was prompt and definitive. “No.
The world is wide, and a few years of one man’s life are
no more than so many texts written in the sand.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong there, Ned. The world is fearfully
small, and its memory of evil deeds is as long as its
charity is short.”</p>

<p>“Let be, then. You are not a woman. You are a
man, and you can fight it out and live it down.”</p>

<p>Brant acquiesced without more ado. “I was merely
stating the case,” he said, as if the matter were quite extraneous
to him. “You have earned the right to set
the pace for me, Ned; and I’ll do whatever you say.”</p>

<p>“That is more like the George Brant I used to know.
And this is what I say: I know a trail across Jack
Mountain that will take us to the railroad in three hours.
The night trains pass at Carbonado, and you will be in
good time to catch whichever one of them you elect to
take, east or west. There is no station on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
side of the mountain; but there is a side track for the
Hoopoee mine, and you can build a fire to flag the train.
Have you money?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Enough?”</p>

<p>“Yes; enough to try whatever experiment you suggest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I have anything to suggest more
than your own good judgment would anticipate. Find
your allotted corner of the big vineyard and go to work
in it; that’s about all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“How deep shall I dive?”</p>

<p>“You will have to decide that for yourself. You
are a Western man now, and I suppose you don’t want
to go back home. How about Denver?”</p>

<p>Brant shook his head slowly. “Denver is good
enough—too good, in fact. I wonder if you will understand
it if I say that I’d much rather have my forty days
in the wilderness before I have to face my kind, even as
a stranger in a strange city?”</p>

<p>“I can understand it perfectly, and the decency of
the thing does you credit. And if that is your notion,
I can help you. You used to be the best man in the
‘Tech.’ at map making; have you forgotten how to do
it?”</p>

<p>“No; a man doesn’t forget his trade.”</p>

<p>“Good. I met Davenport at Carbonado yesterday.
He was on his way to the Colorow district to do a lot of
surveying and plotting, and was sick because he couldn’t
find an assistant before he left Denver. Shall I give you
a note to him?”</p>

<p>“It is exactly what I should crave if I had a shadow
of the right to pick and choose.”</p>

<p>Hobart found pen and paper and wrote the note.</p>

<p>“There you are,” he said. “Davenport is a good
fellow, and you needn’t tell him more than you want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
to. The job will last for two or three months, and by
that time you will know better what you want to do with
yourself. Now, if you are ready, we’ll get a move. It’s
a stiffish climb to the top of the pass.”</p>

<p>They forthfared together and presently set their
feet in the trail leading over the shoulder of the great
mountain buttressing the slope behind the Jessica. The
sounds of strife had ceased in the town below, and but
for the twinkling lights the deep valley might have been
as Nature left it. Since the upward path was rough and
difficult there was scant breath for speech in the long
climb; and for this Brant was thankful. The scene in
Gaynard’s was yet fresh in mind and heart, and not even
to the friend of his youth could he trust himself to
speak freely.</p>

<p>The moon was rising when they reached the summit
of the pass, and Hobart pointed down the farther slope
to a dark mass hugging the steep mountain side.</p>

<p>“That is the Hoopoee shaft house,” he said. “The
railroad is just below it. Got matches and cigars?”</p>

<p>“Yes, both.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go back from here. Good-bye, old fellow,
and God bless you! Tie your courage in a hard
knot, and let me hear from you.”</p>

<p>Brant grasped his friend’s hand and wrung it in
silence. He tried to speak, but the words tripped each
other.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” Hobart broke in. “I know what
you want to say, and can’t. It is nothing more than
you would have done if the saddle had been on the
other horse. And about your—the woman: I’ll do
whatever you could do, if you stayed. Now, then, down
you go, or you’ll miss your train. Good-bye.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE VINTAGE OF ABI-EZER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not always given to prescience, friendly or
other, to reap where it has sown; or to the worthiest intention
to see of the travail of its soul and be satisfied.
But if the time, place, and manner of Brant’s sequestration
had been foreordained from the beginning, the conditions
could scarcely have been more favourable for
bulwark building between an evil past and some hopeful
future of better promise.</p>

<p>The new mining district to which Hobart’s suggestion
sent him was a sky-land wilderness unpeopled as
yet, save by a few pioneer prospectors; his fellow-measurer
of mining claims was a zealot of his profession, who
was well content to take his friend’s friend at his
friend’s valuation, asking no questions; and the work
itself was such a fierce struggle with Nature in her ruggedest
aspect as to afford a very opiate of antidotes to
reflection, reminiscent or forecasting.</p>

<p>So it came about that the heart-hardening past with
its remorseful reminders withdrew more and more into
the dimnesses of willing forgetfulness, and the bulwark
between that which had been and that which might be
grew with the uncalendared days and nights till it bade
fair in time to shut out some of the remorseful vistas.</p>

<p>The claim-measuring came to an end one flawless
day in August, when the aspens were yellow on the
high-pitched slopes and the streams ran low and summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
clear in the gulches. Brant helped in the preparations
for the retreat from the sky land of forgetfulness
with a distinct sense of regret, which grew with every
added mile of the day-long tramp toward Aspen, the
railway, and civilization, until it became no less than a
foreboding. Davenport, well satisfied with an assistant
whose capacity for hard work was commensurate with
his apparent love for it, had made him a proposal pointing
to a partnership survey in a still more remote field,
but Brant had refused. He knew well enough that his
battle of reinstatement was yet to be fought, and that it
must be fought in the field of the wider world. And toward
that field he set his face, though not without misgivings—the
misgivings of one who, having given no
quarter, need expect none.</p>

<p>“So you have made up your mind to go to Denver,
have you?” said Davenport, when they were smoking
the pipe of leave-taking in the lobby of the Aspen hotel.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have made arrangements to go down on
the night train.”</p>

<p>Davenport looked at his watch. “It is about time
you were moving,” he said. “I’ll walk over to the
station with you if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Brant did not mind. On the contrary, he was rather
sorry to part from the man who had been the first to
help raise the bulwark of forgetfulness. But their walk
to the station was wordless, as much of their companionship
had been.</p>

<p>They found the train ready to leave, and at the steps
of the Pullman a party of four, an elderly man and
three women. One of the women was young and pretty,
and she was cloaked and hatted for a journey. So much
Brant saw, and then he came alive to the fact that
Davenport was introducing him. Of the four names he
caught but one—that of the young woman who, it appeared,
was to be his travelling companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Well, now, that is lucky all around,” the elderly
man was saying. “We have been hoping that some one
would turn up at the last minute. Dorothy would go,
whether or— Hello, there!”</p>

<p>The wheels were beginning to turn, and whatever
poor excuse for a launching the acquaintance might
have had in a few minutes of general conversation was
denied it. Brant had no more than time to hand his
charge up the steps of the Pullman, to stand for a moment
beside her while she waved a farewell to the group
on the platform, and his responsibility, such as it was,
was upon him full fledged.</p>

<p>He did not make the most of it, as a better man
might. So far from it, he erred painstakingly on the
side of formality, leading the way with the young woman’s
belongings to her section, asking her rather stiffly
if he could be of any further service to her, and vanishing
promptly to the solitude of the smoking compartment
when her negation set him free.</p>

<p>But once alone in the stuffy luxury of the smoking
den it was inevitable that the tale of the weeks of voluntary
exile should roll itself up like a scroll and vanish,
and that the heart-hardening past, and chiefly the tragic
valedictory of it, should demand the hearing postponed
by the toil-filled interlude in the wilderness. He was
well used to scenes of violence, and there was a strain
of atavistic savagery in him that came to the surface
now and then and bade him look on open-eyed when
stronger men blenched and turned away. But now the
memory of the tragedy in Gaynard’s kennel laid hold of
him and shook him in the very stronghold of ruthlessness.
He could not pretend to be deeply grieved, for
the woman had been little better than an evil genius to
him; and yet he would willingly have thrust his own
life between her and the destroyer. Instead, she had
done that for him, though he did not harrow himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
needlessly with the thought that she had intentionally
given her life for his. He knew her well enough to be
sure that she was only trying to save herself. None the
less, when all was said, it was a tragedy of the kind to
leave scars deep and abiding, and the remembrance of
it might well threaten to be the dregs in any cup of
hope.</p>

<p>For his swift retaliation on the slayer he took no
remorseful thought, and for this environment was responsible.
In the frontier mining camps, where law is
not, men defend their lives and redress their wrongs
with the strong hand, and one needs not to be an aggressive
brawler to learn to strike fierce blows and
shrewd. So in the matter of retaliation Brant was
sorry only that, for all his good will, he had not slain
the ruffian outright.</p>

<p>That the heart-hardening past with its grim pictures
should thus obtrude itself upon his return to civilization
seemed natural enough, and Brant suffered it as a part
of the penalty he must pay. Not in any moment of
the long evening did he remotely connect the sorry
memories with the young woman in Section Six, who
was at most no more than a name to him. Nevertheless,
though he knew it not, it was the young woman who was
chiefly responsible. If a good man’s introduction had
not made him accountable for the welfare of a good
woman, Brant might have smoked a cigar and gone to
bed without this first reckoning with the past.</p>

<p>As it was, he smoked many cigars and was driven
forth of the smoking-room only when the porter, avid
of sleep himself, had suggested for the third time that
the gentleman’s berth was ready. Even then sleep was
not to be had for the wooing, and the gray dawn light
sifting through the chinks around the window shades
found him still wakeful.</p>

<p>The sun of a new day was half-meridian high when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the porter parted the curtains of the berth and shook
his single man passenger.</p>

<p>“Time to get up, sah; twenty minutes to de breakfas’ station.”</p>

<p>Brant yawned sleepily and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Breakfast? Why, it’s ten o’clock, and we ought
to have been in Denver an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah. Been laid out all night, mostly, sah;
fust wid a freight wreck, and den wid a hot box.”</p>

<p>Brant remembered vaguely that there had been stoppages
many and long, but with the memory mill agrind
he had not remarked them.</p>

<p>In the lavatory he found the porter ostentatiously
putting towels in the racks for his single man passenger.</p>

<p>“Light car this morning, John?” he asked.</p>

<p>The negro grinned. “Yes, sah; you’ right about
dat, sholy, sah. You-all come mighty close to hab’n a
special cyar last night, sah.”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sah. De young lady and you-all had de
Hesp’rus all to you’ own selves. Po’ portah ain’t gwine
get rich out o’ dis trip, sholy.”</p>

<p>“No, I should say not.” Brant was sluicing his
face in the dodging basin at the moment, but a little
later, when he had a dry pocket hand, he gave the porter
a coin of price.</p>

<p>“Take good care of the lady, John; they don’t remember
about these little things, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, sah—t’ank you kin’ly, sah—dat dey don’t.
But I’s take mighty good keer o’ dat young lady now,
sah. Is—is you-all ’quaintin’ wid her, sah?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t so much as seen her face,” said Brant,
which was near enough the literal truth to stand uncorrected.
And a few minutes later he went back into the
body of the car to repair the omission.</p>

<p>What he saw stirred that part of him which had long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
lain dormant. She was sitting in lonely state in the
otherwise unoccupied car, and his first impression, at
half-car-length range, was that she was a sweet incarnation
of goodness of the protectable sort. Whereupon
he shut the door upon the past and betook himself to
her section with a kindly offer of service.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Langford,” he began. “I
hope you rested well. We are coming to the breakfast
station, and there will doubtless be the usual
scramble. May I have the pleasure of looking after
your wants?”</p>

<p>Her smile was of answering good will, and he had
time to observe that the honest gray eyes were deep
wells of innocent frankness; and when she made answer,
there was something in her speech to tell him that
she was neither of the outspoken West nor of the self-contained
East.</p>

<p>“It was kind of you to think of me,” she said.
“But I think I needn’t trouble you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t call it trouble—it will be a pleasure,” he insisted;
and when she had made room for him on the opposite
seat he sat down.</p>

<p>“We are very late, are we not?” she asked.</p>

<p>“So late that we are not likely to get in before
night, I’m afraid. A freight wreck and a hot box, the
porter says.”</p>

<p>“I thought something was the matter. The train
has been stopping all through the night, and I could
hear them working at the car every time I awoke.”</p>

<p>“I heard them, too,” said Brant, though his memory
of the stoppages was of the vaguest. “It didn’t
impress me at the time, but it does now. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>She laughed at this, and confessed a fellow-feeling.</p>

<p>“So am I; and I was just hoping for two things:
a good breakfast, and time enough to enjoy it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“We are pretty sure of the first, because the Van
Noy people always set a good table; but as to the time,
our being so late will probably cut it short. If you
please, we’ll go out to the front platform and so be
ready to get in ahead of the rush.”</p>

<p>She went with him willingly enough, and a little
later they were partakers of the swift down-grade rush
of the train in the open air. It was before the day of
vestibuled platforms on the mountain lines, and when
the lurching and swaying of the car made the footing
precarious he slipped his arm through hers for safety’s
sake.</p>

<p>And she permitted it, does some one gasp? Yea,
verily; and, since she was much too clean-hearted to be
constantly on the watch for unworthy motives in others,
thought no harm of it. Moreover, Brant’s conclusion
that she was neither of the East nor the West was well
founded in fact, and this had something to do with her
frank trust in him. She was Tennessee born and bred,
and to a Southern girl all men are gentlemen until they
prove themselves otherwise.</p>

<p>And as for Brant, if she had been an angel of light,
preaching repentance and a better mind to the hardened
sinner of the mining camps, nothing she could have
said or done would have touched him so nearly as this
tacit acceptance of his protection. But also it gave him
a soul-harrowing glimpse of the bottomless chasm separating
the chivalrous gentleman of her maidenly imaginings
from one George Brant, late of Silverette and
Gaynard’s faro bank. How this clean-hearted young
woman would shrink from him if she could but dimly
imagine the manner of man he was! There was honest
shame and humiliation in the thought; and in so far as
these may give a moral uplift, Brant was the better man
for the experience. None the less, he was glad when
the train slowed into the breakfast station and the demands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of the present once more shut the door upon the
past and its disquieting reminders.</p>

<p>Having a clear field for the run across the station
platform, Brant and his charge were the first to reach
the dining room, and they had chosen their table and
given their order before the other seats were taken. As
a matter of course, Brant’s order was filled first, and
thereat his vis à vis, a hard-featured man in a linen
duster and a close-fitting skullcap, broke forth in remonstrance.</p>

<p>“That is the curse of the tip system!” he growled,
looking pointedly at Brant and addressing no one in
particular. “I object to it on principle, and every self-respecting
traveller ought to help put it down.”</p>

<p>Brant’s eyelids narrowed and the steel-gray eyes behind
them shot back a look that aforetime had quelled
more than one wild beast of the gaming tables. But
he held his peace, and here the matter might have rested
if the irascible fault-finder had not seen the look and
accepted it as a challenge.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I referred to you!” he exploded, hurling
the explanation at Brant’s head. “I submit it to the
entire company if it is fair for you to monopolize the attention
of the servants while the rest of us go hungry?”</p>

<p>Now Brant was by nature a very madman of impulse,
but the one good thing he had brought out of the hard
school of lawlessness was the ability to be fiercely wrathful
without showing it. So he said, placably enough:
“I am sure you will excuse me if I decline to discuss
the question with you. We were the first comers, and
my order was given before you sat down.”</p>

<p>Here again the matter might have rested, but the
hard-featured critic must needs have the last word:</p>

<p>“What I said, sir, had no reference to the matter of
precedence. What I particularly object to is the shameless
subsidizing of the servants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Whereupon Brant, who was as yet innocent of the
implied charge, took occasion to call the waiter who
had served him and to fee him openly in sight of all
and sundry. The man in the linen duster scowled his
disapproval, but, inasmuch as his own breakfast was
served, said nothing. There was a lull in the threatened
storm, and Brant was still congratulating himself
on his own magnanimity, when hostilities broke out
afresh. His charge had finished her breakfast, and he
had prevailed upon her to take a second cup of coffee.
When it came, the man across the table, who had given
a similar order, claimed it for his own. Brant expostulated,
still in set terms exuding the very honey of
forbearance. The tyrant of breakfast tables fell into
the trap, mistook his man completely, and in a sharp
volley of incivilities proved that a soft answer may not
always deflect the course of righteous indignation. In
the midst of the volley Miss Langford rose to leave the
table.</p>

<p>That was the final straw, and it broke the back of
Brant’s self-control. Rising quickly, he leaned across
the table and smote the offender out of his chair; one
open-handed blow it asked for, and it was given with
red wrath to speed it. That done, he took the arm
of his companion and stalked out of the dining room
before the smitten one could gather breath for an explosion.</p>

<p>Brant marched his charge straight to the Pullman,
drawing deep warrior breaths of defiance world-inclusive;
but by the time they were halfway across the platform
he came to his senses sufficiently to be heartily
ashamed of himself; nay, more, to be ready to welcome
anything which might come by way of reproach. But
whatever Miss Langford thought of it, she was self-contained
enough to keep her own counsel, and they
boarded the train in silence. In the seclusion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
deserted sleeping car Brant laid fast hold of his courage
and said what he might by way of apology.</p>

<p>“I can’t ask your forgiveness, Miss Langford,” he
began; “I know I have put myself beyond that. But I
beg you to let me say just one word in my own defence.
For years I have been roughing it in these mountains,
eating at tables where that man’s insolence would cost
him his life before he could measure words with the
mildest man in the camp. And so I forgot myself for
the moment—forgot what was due you. Now I’ll make
the only reparation I can, and keep out of your sight for
the rest of the day.”</p>

<p>And straightway he vanished without giving her a
chance to reply.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>“THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> set himself to expiate his fault, Brant wore
out the day in the smoking compartment in comfortless
solitude, doing penance by limiting himself to one cigar
an hour. It was dull work, but not altogether profitless.
For one thing there was plenty of time to think;
and for another the expiatory mill had a chance to
grind out a goodly grist of conclusions. The first of
these was that there were going to be more obstacles in
the way to amendment than those interposed by an uncharitable
world; that apart from the sharp fight on the
firing line, he was likely to have trouble with an insubordinate
garrison.</p>

<p>Now a fine scorn of obstacles was another of the lessons
learned in the hard school of abandonment, and
Brant set his teeth on a doughty resolution to override
them in the race for retrieval, as he had overridden them
in the mad gallop pitward. Self-respect, or some comforting
measure of it, should be regained though the
devil himself held the present reversion of it. There
should yet come a day, please God, when he would not
be constrained in common decency to put the length
of a Pullman car between himself and a good woman.
Moreover, the past should henceforth be a dead past,
and woe betide the enemy, man or devil, who should
have the temerity to resurrect it.</p>

<p>The gage of battle thus thrown to the powers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
darkness was promptly taken up. After one of the
many stops with the troublesome axle the rear brakeman
came into the smoking compartment and sat down,
as one weary. To begin at once the shedding of
the churl shell of the master gambler, Brant nodded
pleasantly; whereupon the brakeman passed the time
of day and immediately began, railwaywise, to abuse
his calling and to ease his mind in respect of the hot
box.</p>

<p>“She never has made a run yet without keeping
everybody on the keen jump,” he declared. “By gum!
I’ve been chasing up and down with the dope kettle ever
since one o’clock this morning.”</p>

<p>“She?” said Brant, to whom railway speech was an
unknown tongue.</p>

<p>“Yes; this here car—the Hesp’rus. Last time we
had her it was the back box on this end; now it’s the
for’ard one under the drawing-room—blazing away like
a blooming track torch more’n half the time.”</p>

<p>“Keeps you busy, does it?”</p>

<p>“You’re mighty right it does. And when I have a
job like this, I like to have some blame’ fool pilgrim
come up and begin to jaw about the soft snap a brakeman
has now they have the air brakes.”</p>

<p>“Did somebody do that?”</p>

<p>“Sure; first thing this morning. Big chap in a
linen duster and smoking cap; same one that—” The
brakeman stopped short, as one who suddenly finds himself
treading upon what may prove to be dangerous
ground.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Brant encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean the fellow you had the scrap with.
Great Moses! but he was hot!”</p>

<p>“Was he? So was I.”</p>

<p>“You’d better believe he was. Came out of that
dining room rearin’ like a buckin’ bronco; said he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
going to have the law on you, and wanted the old man
to wire ahead for a policeman to meet the train.”</p>

<p>“What old man—the conductor?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and Harker told him he couldn’t do it, because
the row didn’t happen on the train; said he didn’t
know who you was, anyway. Then I chipped in, and
told ’em you was Plucky George, the man that cleaned
out the six toughs when they tried to run the bank up
at Silverette. Holy Smoke! but you ought to’ve seen
old linen duster fall apart when I said that!” The
brakeman laughed joyously, but Brant groaned in spirit
at this ominous hint that his reputation meant to keep
pace with him.</p>

<p>“You’d better believe he was rattled right!” the
man went on. “He just went yaller, and the last I saw
of him he was up ahead, looking for you so’t he could
apologize. Ain’t that rich?”</p>

<p>“Very rich,” said Brant grimly. Then he saw his
advantage and made good use of it. “In fact, it is
much too rich to spoil. Go find the fellow and tell him
I’m in a bad humour, but that he is safe as long as he
keeps away from me. Will you do that?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented the brakeman, getting upon his
feet. “I’ll do better than that: I’ll scare him till he
won’t get a good breath this side o’ the Missouri River.”</p>

<p>Brant’s eyes narrowed, and in the turning of a leaf
the mantle of humility slipped from him and he became
Brant the man-queller.</p>

<p>“You will do nothing of the sort. You will tell
him just what I say, and no word more or less. Now
go.”</p>

<p>The man of dope kettles and rear-end signals was no
coward, but neither was he minded to pick a quarrel
with the hero of a dozen savage battles. Brant let him
get to the door and then called him back:</p>

<p>“Where does your run end?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Voltamo; next stop but one.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t go into Denver?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But some time you may. In that case, it will be
as well for you to forget what little you may happen to
know about me. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“You’d better believe I do. I can hold my jaw
with anybody when I have to; and I don’t have to be
hit with a club neither.”</p>

<p>“Good. Have a cigar—and don’t forget what I
say.”</p>

<p>The brakeman took the proffered cigar and vanished;
and thereupon Brant began to repent once more
and to grope for the lost mantle of humility. Here on
the very heels of his good resolutions he had balked at
one of the smallest of the obstacles, bullying a man in
his displeasure and trading upon his reputation as a
man-queller like any desperado of the camps. It was
humiliating, but it proved the wisdom of the smoking-room
exile. Truly, he was far enough from being a
fitting companion for the young woman in Section Six.</p>

<p>As he had predicted, the train lost time steadily
throughout the day, and an early supper was served at
the regular dinner station. Brant went to the dining
room with the other passengers, and when Miss Langford
did not appear, he sent the porter to her with a
luncheon and a cup of tea.</p>

<p>“It is about what I had a right to expect,” he told
himself when he was once more back in the solitude of
the smoke den. “She was afraid to trust herself in the
same dining room with me. Why the devil couldn’t I
have held my cursed temper just ten seconds longer?
Here I’ve had to sit all day and eat my heart out, when
I might have been getting miles away from the old life
in her company. What a fool a man can make of himself
when he tries!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“That is a fact,” said a voice from the opposite seat;
and Brant, who had been staring gloomily out of the
window at the wall of blackness slipping past the train,
and so was unaware that he was not alone, was unreasonable
enough to be angry.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” he began wrathfully, turning
upon his commentator; but the pleasant face of the
young man in the opposite seat was of the kind which
disarms wrath.</p>

<p>“It’s on me,” he laughed. “I beg your pardon. I
spoke without thinking, but what you said about the
fool-making faculty calls for general ratification. We
all have it.”</p>

<p>Brant nodded, and the newcomer relighted his cigar,
which had gone out in the explanation. “Going in to
Denver?” he asked, willing to let interest atone for impudence.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Wish I were. I’ve been out a week now, and I’m
beginning to long for the fleshpots.”</p>

<p>“You have my sympathy if you have to stop overnight
anywhere between this and Denver,” said Brant,
who knew the country.</p>

<p>“Luckily, I don’t have to. I am merely riding down
to the meeting point with Number Three to kill time.
I have to go back to Voltamo to-night.”</p>

<p>Brant laughed. “Do you find it cheaper to ride
than to wait?”</p>

<p>“It is quite as cheap in my case; the railway company
has to foot the bills, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Oh—you are in the service, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Engineer corps?”</p>

<p>“No; operating department. I am chief clerk in
the superintendent’s office.”</p>

<p>They smoked companionably for a while, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Brant said: “Perhaps you can tell me some of the
things I want to find out. Who is your chief engineer
now?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Bowran.”</p>

<p>“Good fellow?”</p>

<p>“Out of sight; gentleman of the old school, you
know; West Point, regular army, and all that. They
say he won’t hire a chainman unless he is a college
graduate.”</p>

<p>“Is his office in Denver?”</p>

<p>“Yes; right next door to ours.”</p>

<p>“All of which is comforting,” said Brant. “I hope
you will have me for a neighbour. I am going to try
for a billet on the C. E. &amp; W.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the chief clerk, rising at the
sound of the locomotive whistle. “My name’s Antrim,
and you will find me in Superintendent Craig’s office.
Latchstring hangs on the outer wall.”</p>

<p>“And my name is Brant. Do you quit us here?”</p>

<p>“Got to do it—wish I hadn’t, now. Glad to have
met you, I’m sure. Don’t forget to hunt me up. Good
night.”</p>

<p>They shook hands heartily at parting. It was Colorado,
in the day when strangers became friends—or
enemies—on the spot; when one unconsciously dropped
the “Mr.” in an hour, and then slipped easily around
the surname to hobnob with Tom, Dick, or Harry in
the first interview.</p>

<p>For the exile the little chat with the chief clerk was
heartening in its way; and when the train was once
more swaying and lurching along its crooked course
down the cañon he looked at his watch and figured out
the probable arriving time.</p>

<p>“Eleven hours late; that will make it ten o’clock in
Denver. I wonder if Miss Langford will find somebody
to look after her when she gets in. If she doesn’t——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>The interruption was the advent of the porter. The
negro had been trying to get speech with his patron for
half an hour, but he was much too discreet to deliver his
message in Antrim’s presence.</p>

<p>“’Bout de supper, sah; de lady in lower Six say,
T’ank you kin’ly, sah, and would you-all be so kind and
step back in de cyar a minute?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.” Brant rose to comply, but he was no
sooner on his feet than he was thrown violently all
across the compartment.</p>

<p>“Golly Lawd! she’s on de ties!” gasped the negro,
and the exclamation ended in a yell of terror.</p>

<p>Brant kept his head, and thought only of the
young woman alone in the body of the car. With
the floor heaving and bounding under him like the
deck of a storm-tossed ship, he darted out of the
smoking-room and flung himself against the swinging
door in the narrow side vestibule. It was jammed,
but the glass of the upper panel fell in fragments
under his blow, and he was past the obstruction
when the end came. The heavy sleeper lurched first
to the right, reeled drunkenly for a critical instant on
the brink of the embankment facing the river, righted
itself with a jerk when draw bars and safety chains
gave way, and then settled back to topple over against
the cañon wall, stopping with a crash that sent
Brant to his knees just as he was starting down the
aisle.</p>

<p>The broken glass was still falling from the shattered
deck lights when he reached Section Six. The
young woman was unhurt, but she was very pale, and
the gray eyes were full of terror.</p>

<p>“Don’t faint,” said Brant very gently, though he
was wondering what he should do in case she did. “It
is all over now, I think.”</p>

<p>“But the others?” she faltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Let us hope that the other cars have kept the
track—that it is only the ‘wreck of the Hesperus.’”</p>

<p>She smiled at the conceit, and asked what they
should do.</p>

<p>“If you will promise not to faint while I am gone,
I’ll go and find out. There is no danger now.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to faint; but please don’t be gone
long.”</p>

<p>He was back in a moment, gathering up her belongings.</p>

<p>“There is nothing smashed but our car,” he explained.
“They will leave flagmen with it, and go on
to Denver with the remainder of the train. Will you
take my arm?”</p>

<p>The wrecked sleeper was already surrounded by a
throng of curious passengers and anxious trainmen, and
ready hands were extended to help them down from
the uptilted platform. But Brant put them all aside,
and lifted his companion to the ground as if the right
were his alone.</p>

<p>“It is all right, Mr. Harker,” he said, singling out
the conductor. “I mean, we are all out. There was
no one else in the car except the porter, and he isn’t
hurt.”</p>

<p>They made their way through the throng of curious
ones, and so on down the track to the train. Brant
found a seat in the day coach, disposed his charge comfortably
therein, and then, once more laying hold of
his courage, sat down beside her.</p>

<p>“I am not going to leave you again until I see you
safe in Denver,” he asserted; “that is, unless you send
me away.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t send you away this morning,” she rejoined,
with a smile that went far toward making him
forget for the moment who and what he was.</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t; but you had a right to. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
after what I had done, there was nothing for it but to
take myself off.”</p>

<p>She did not speak until the train was once more
lurching on its way. Then she said: “I thought at
the time you were very patient; and—and I think
so still.”</p>

<p>“Do you, really? That is very good of you; but I
think I don’t deserve it. My first thought should have
been for you, and I might have kept my temper for another
half minute.”</p>

<p>Now this young woman could rejoice in an excellent
upbringing, as will presently appear, and she knew perfectly
well that Brant was right. But where is the
woman, old or young, who does not secretly glory in a
vigorous championship of her rights, even at the expense
of the proprieties?</p>

<p>So she spoke him fair, telling him that she was sending
for him at the moment of the accident to thank him
and to pay him for her supper. Nay, more: she made
the next two hours so pleasant for him that they were as
but a watch in the night, and their flitting seemed to
push his life in the camps into a comfortably remote
past.</p>

<p>And so they chatted amicably until the outlying
lights of Denver began to flash past the windows;
and then Brant bethought him of her further well-being.</p>

<p>“Will there be some one at the train to meet you?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>“No; but my street-car line is only a block from
the depot, and the car takes me almost to our door.”</p>

<p>“I will put you on the car,” he said; and this he did
some few minutes later, bidding her “Good night,” and
standing in the street to catch a last glimpse of her as
the car droned away to the northward. Then he turned
away to seek a hotel, and was well uptown before he remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
that he had not thought to ask her address,
or to ask if he might call upon her.</p>

<p>“But that is all right,” he mused. “Denver isn’t
London, and if I can ever pull myself up into the ranks
of the well-behaved, I shall find her.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE MIGRANTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> was, and is no more, when invalids, hopeful
and hopeless, thronged the eastern foothills of the Rockies
till there was no longer houseroom for them in the
cities, and a new word “lunger” was grafted upon the
exuberant stock of Western folk speech to distinguish
them. Unlike the pioneers of a still earlier day, who
crossed the plains with their worldly possessions snugly
sheltered beneath the canvas tilt of a single prairie
schooner, these migrants for health’s sake were chiefly
of the class which neither toils nor spins, and to the
foothill cities they presently added suburbs architecturally
characteristic each after its kind. In these suburbs
the trim-built town house of New England is the
commonest type, but the more florid style of the middle
West is not lacking, and now and then, in the roomier
city fringe, there are replicas done in red brick of the
low-storied, wide-verandaed country house of the
South.</p>

<p>Such was the home of the Langfords in the Highlands
of North Denver. Driven from the ancestral
acres in the blue-grass region of Tennessee in the
late afternoon of his life, the judge had determined to
make the new home in the life-giving altitudes as nearly
like the old as money and the materials at hand would
compass, and he had succeeded passing well. He had
bought acres where others bought lots, and the great
roomy house, with its low-pitched roof and wide verandas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
on three sides, stood in the midst of whatsoever
Tennessee greenery would stand transplantation from
the blue-grass region to the less genial climate of the
clear-skied altitudes.</p>

<p>On pleasant Sunday afternoons, when Dorothy was
at her mission school and the judge slept peacefully in
his own particular chair, when Mrs. Langford followed
her husband’s example in the privacy of her room, and
Will was no one ever knew just where, the hammock
slung at the corner of the veranda which commanded a
view of the mountains was Isabel’s especial convenience.
For one reason, there was the view; for another, the
hammock swung opposite that portion of the low railing
which was Harry Antrim’s favourite perch during
the hour or two which measured his customary Sunday
afternoon visit.</p>

<p>Being very much in love with Isabel, Antrim was
quite willing to turn his back upon the scenery for the
sake of looking at her. And as between a winsome
young woman swinging in a hammock—a young woman
with laughing brown eyes and a profusion of glory-tinted
hair framing a face to which piquancy and youthful
beauty lent equal charms—who but a scenery-mad
pilgrim of the excursion trains would think of making
a comparison?</p>

<p>In these Sunday afternoon talks Isabel could be abstract
or concrete as occasion demanded. What time
the young man dwelt overmuch on railway matters, she
found it convenient to be able to look over his shoulder
at the mighty panorama unrolled and unrolling itself
in endless transformation scenes against the western
horizon. And when Antrim, finding himself ignored,
would come back from things practical to things personal,
she had but to close her eyes to the scenic background
and to open them again upon the personality of
her companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Conceding nothing to what he was pleased to call
her artistic fad, Antrim was willing to condone Isabel’s
indifference to railway affairs. His business was a part,
the greater part, of his life, but he could understand
why Judge Langford’s daughter, as such, might easily
weary of railway shop talk. True, there had been more
or less of it all along in the old days in Tennessee, when
the judge was counsel for the railway company of which
Antrim’s father was the superintendent; but that was
because the Langfords and Antrims dwelt side by side
and were friends as well as neighbours. Here in Colorado
it was different. The judge was an invalid—a migrant
for health’s sake, with gear sufficient to make him
independent of railway counsellorships, and with little
left of his former connection save a pocketful of annual
passes and a warm affection for the son of his old friend
the superintendent.</p>

<p>None the less, Antrim thought that Isabel might
bear with him now and then, if only for the reason that
she would at some time begin to eat the bread and meat
of railway service and so continue to the end of the
chapter. This, indeed, he had the temerity to say to
her one Sunday afternoon some weeks after his return
from the exile of division duty at Voltamo. By which
it will be seen that Antrim was a very young man, and
as yet no more than a novice in the fine art of love-making.</p>

<p>“I do take an interest in your affairs, Harry; you
know I do. I am glad to see you succeeding in something
you really like. But I wish”—she stopped, and
let her gaze go beyond him—“I wish you wouldn’t always
talk as if—” She paused again, and Antrim finished
the protest for her:</p>

<p>“As if my prospects and your future were one and
the same thing, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it stirs me up and makes me feel resentful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
I know I can’t paint very much yet, but that is no reason
why I shouldn’t attain by and by, is it?”</p>

<p>“None in the world. It’s only when you side-track
me for art that I get restive. No man could be patient
under that. Besides, you are never going to be a bachelor
of art; you are going to be married to me, and then
you can paint for fun as much as you like.”</p>

<p>Isabel’s retort was emphasized by a piquant little
grimace of defiance:</p>

<p>“That is what you have been telling me ever since
I can remember. I didn’t mind it so much in the
boy and girl stage; but when you say such things now,
it only makes it more than ever impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why does it?”</p>

<p>“Because it shows that you still cling to the idea
that my love for art is nothing but a schoolgirl fad. It
isn’t anything of the kind; and you and father and all
the rest of them ought to know it by this time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” said Antrim, relapsing into disgusted
silence.</p>

<p>Isabel touched the toe of her slipper to the floor
and swung the hammock gently. As a comrade, brother—as
anything, in fact, but a lover—she fellowshipped
Antrim with hearty frankness. They had known each
other from early childhood, and the outspoken familiarity
of such an acquaintance is not to be set aside by the
mere formality of a one-sided love-making.</p>

<p>He was a nice boy, she thought, suffering herself
to moralize a little while he was recovering his equanimity.
He always looked so well groomed, and his severe
taste in the matter of raiment was very creditable.
And he was capable, too; every one said that of him.
Still he was but a boy; and his smooth-shaven face
made him look years younger than he really was; and
he wouldn’t wear a mustache, as she wanted him to;
and—and——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Why don’t you say something?” snapped the subject
of her moralizings.</p>

<p>“I was thinking about you, and I supposed you
would be glad to have me keep quiet if I would do that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. It depends very much
upon what you were thinking. I could tell better if I
heard the recapitulation.”</p>

<p>Isabel tossed her head disdainfully. “Anybody
would give me a penny for my thoughts,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, if it’s a pecuniary matter, here”—and he took
a coin from his pocket and gave it to her.</p>

<p>“Thanks! I need some new brushes, and father
says I am extravagant. Now you shall have what you
have paid for. I was thinking that you know how to
dress becomingly—and that you are smart—and that
your salary is enough to make poor people envious—and
that you look absurdly young—and that a mustache
would make you look years older—a-n-d——”</p>

<p>Antrim sawed the air with his arm as he would have
slowed down a reckless engineer.</p>

<p>“That will do; you have earned the dollar. But
you won’t mind my saying that I can get myself abused
for less money. Do you ever have a really serious
thought, Isabel? Take time to think about it, and tell
me honestly.”</p>

<p>Again Isabel’s gaze went past him, bridging the bare
plain and seeking infinity in the heights rising in
mighty grandeur beyond the flat top of Table Mountain.
When she spoke, raillery had given place to enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Could any one live in sight of that”—pointing to
the high-piled grandeur—“and not have thoughts too
big for any kind of expression?”</p>

<p>“Oh, artistic thoughts, yes; I’ll admit that you can
outthink most people on that line,” he rejoined.</p>

<p>“That is right; gird, if you want to. You are a
Philistine, and you can’t help it, I suppose. Just the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
same, art is the real reality, and your petty business affairs
are merely the playthings of life. If I could put
on canvas the faintest impression, the merest foreshadowing
of what you can see over there, every other accomplishment
or enjoyment in the world would seem
little by comparison.”</p>

<p>“There you go again,” said Antrim. “Now I like
pretty things as well as anybody, but when you try to
make me believe that the painting of them is the chief
end of man—or of woman, for that matter—why, it’s
like—” He searched for a sufficiently strong simile,
and not finding one, ended rather irrelevantly. “Between
you and Brant, I have a hard time of it trying to
keep my feet on the everyday earth.”</p>

<p>Isabel ignored the tirade and went off at a tangent,
as was her custom with Antrim.</p>

<p>“Mr. Brant is a college graduate, isn’t he?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so. What of it?” demanded Antrim,
who was so wholly imbued with the afflatus of
business as to think small of scholarly attainments.</p>

<p>“Nothing; only I was thinking how much a college
man has to be thankful for.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see your point,” Antrim objected. “Take
Brant, for instance; how is he any better off than the
rest of us?”</p>

<p>“The mere fact that you can ask such a question
is its best answer,” replied Isabel pertly. “You are a
specialist; you have lived in a business rut until you
can’t see out over the edges. You know that rut well
enough, I suppose, but you would be utterly helpless if
you should ever happen to be dragged out of it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to be dragged out of it. A rut is
a good thing when you come to know it well. Furthermore,
I never saw the time when I was as helpless as
the average college graduate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“That is nonsense,” said Isabel sweetly. “And,
besides, it isn’t original nonsense; you have had it said
for you by every self-made man the world ever saw.
The college man has this advantage in your own particular
field: he can usually take hold of things where
other people leave off. That isn’t mine; it’s father’s.
But I agree with him.”</p>

<p>It was Antrim’s turn to scoff. “I don’t believe
that. I have seen too many of them shoved into railway
positions that they couldn’t hold down. There
was Pollard, on the west end—given a division when he
didn’t know the difference between a mogul and a
switch engine. Nice mess he made of it before he got
through.”</p>

<p>“That may be; but at the same time Mr. Pollard
had probably forgotten more things than most railway
men ever know. Now, there is Mr. Brant; he doesn’t
ever have to talk ‘shop.’ He knows books, and art, and
penology, and a hundred other things.”</p>

<p>Whereat Antrim lost patience, as who would not?</p>

<p>“Brant be hanged!” he exclaimed wrathfully. “I
am sick and tired of having him held up to me as an example.
I wish I had never brought him here!”</p>

<p>“Thank you for nothing,” snapped Isabel; and for
five full minutes neither of them spoke. As usual, it
was the man who finally made the overture toward
peace.</p>

<p>“How is the ‘Sunset in the Platte Cañon’ coming
on?” he asked placably.</p>

<p>“It is done—as much as anything of that kind ever
is done.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go in and look at it?”</p>

<p>Isabel got out of the hammock rather reluctantly,
and they tiptoed past the sleeper at the other end of
the veranda. In the room which Isabel called her studio
she uncovered a canvas on an easel and ran the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
shades up to get a better light. Antrim made a proper
show of examining the picture, and was silent so long
that she was moved to say, “Well?” with a sharp little
upward inflection.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” he admitted good-naturedly. “You
say I can’t criticise, and when I try, it only makes you
angry.”</p>

<p>“It is your duty to try, anyway. Besides, I am in a
lovely temper to-day.”</p>

<p>Antrim had his own opinion as to that, but he stood
off and tried to imagine himself at the impossible point
of view from which the picture was painted. Failing
utterly in this, he drew up a chair and sat down to go
over it patiently for small errors in detail. Isabel presently
grew restive, knowing well from past experience
what was coming.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to me that the station at Buck
Creek looks just like that,” he said at length. “It’s a
longer building than you have made it, and the platform
comes out farther this way.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?” asked the artist sweetly.</p>

<p>“Yes; you have put two gondolas and a box car here
on the side track. I don’t believe there ever were that
many cars set out there at one time.”</p>

<p>“How dreadfully unfortunate!” said Isabel, with
well-simulated concern.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is rather awkward. Can’t you paint one
or two of them out? Then, you have put this switch
stand on the wrong side of the track; the engineer
couldn’t see that target until he got right up to it, and
then he’d be in the ditch.”</p>

<p>Isabel said, “Yes—go on”; and Antrim went on,
glad enough to have found something which he was
competent to criticise.</p>

<p>“Then, these cars again: if you don’t paint them
out you’d better paint them over. There are no high-sided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span> 
gondolas on the narrow gauge, and no cars of any
kind as big as these you have here.”</p>

<p>It was unkind of Isabel to stand at the back of his
chair where he could see none of the signs of the gathering
storm, and there was no note of warning in her
reply.</p>

<p>“Do you really think they are too large?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think; I know. And I’ll prove it to you,”
said he, confidently, taking his pencil and a slip of
paper, and making sundry measurements on the station
building in the picture. “Now, see here: this is what
I mean. If you have kept the proportions right on this
building, it ought to be about six feet between these two
marks. Using that for a scale, you see these cars are
about twice as long as they ought to be. And when you
come to the height——”</p>

<p>Isabel flung the cloth over the painting and burst
out passionately: “That is enough; it’s a picture—not
a mechanical drawing! I knew there were miles
enough between us, but you never miss a chance to
count them all over to me. I——”</p>

<p>She choked, and turned quickly to the window,
and Antrim, who was slow to anger, tried to make
amends.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “You know I told you it was
no use. I’ll admit that I don’t know a good picture
when I look at it.”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t trouble you to look at any more of mine.”
This to the window.</p>

<p>“I like to look at them; and I’ll praise them, too,
if that is what you want. But you always say you want
criticism.”</p>

<p>“And so I do, but I don’t care to be made fun
of.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t making fun of you; I was merely pointing
out the things I know are wrong. And what I said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
may be nothing against the picture as a work of art;
it may be a masterpiece, for all I know about such
things.” This he said, being willing to pour still more
oil on the troubled waters.</p>

<p>“You didn’t say anything at all about the colouring.”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t know anything at all about colour—unless
it’s the colour of your eyes and hair. Let’s
drop it, Isabel, and talk about something of a great deal
more importance—to me. When are you going to put
me out of my misery?”</p>

<p>The time was ill chosen, and she answered him accordingly:</p>

<p>“That is dead and buried; there is no use in going
back to it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” he insisted. “I have waited pretty
patiently for a long time, Isabel, and—and—well, I
can’t wait always.”</p>

<p>But Isabel was still tingling with pique, and she replied
without so much as turning her head.</p>

<p>“End it, then. I never asked you to wait.”</p>

<p>He was on his feet in a moment.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk that way,” he pleaded; “it hurts. I
am not going to urge you any more now, because you
are angry about the picture. But I want to say this: I
can’t take a jesting answer, or an angry one, always.
When we speak of it again you must either take me or
send me away; and—and you’ll listen to reason, won’t
you, Isabel?”</p>

<p>She continued to look steadfastly out of the window
and gave him no word of encouragement.</p>

<p>“Won’t you, Isabel?” he repeated.</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>“Isabel, I’m going now.”</p>

<p>She did not speak or move until she heard the
front gate latch behind him. Then she ran to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
easel and snatched the cloth from the newly finished
picture.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hate you!” she burst out spitefully; and
when Dorothy came in, a few minutes later, the offending
canvas had disappeared from the post of honour in
the studio.</p>

<small>THE SCALE ASCENDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for Brant and the successive steps in his reformatory
experiment leading up to the good repute hinted
at by Isabel’s praise, fortune, good and ill, had befallen
in this wise.</p>

<p>After the incident on the Denver journey and his
instant recognition by a chance brakeman on the train,
he had steeled himself, looking for similar embarrassments
at every turn. But uphill paths are not always
rough or slippery throughout, and in proof of this the
beginnings were made easy for him. From the first he
met no inopportune acquaintances, and, again, the question
of employment answered itself congenially and
promptly. Colonel Bowran needed a draughtsman;
also, he happened to hold Brant’s college in high repute,
since its Professor of Mathematics had been an alumnus
of his own <i>alma mater</i>. This and that, yoked together,
ploughed Brant’s furrow for him; and two days
after his arrival in Denver he was perched upon a high
stool in the chief engineer’s office, giving himself mind
and heart to the practice of a profession which had once
been an artistic passion with him.</p>

<p>A fortnight later Antrim came back, the acquaintance
was renewed, and Brant exchanged his room at the
hotel for lodgings in the quiet private house recommended
by the chief clerk. For a few weeks the reincarnated
one went about his business circumspectly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
spending his days at the office and his evenings with
a fresh gathering of books in his room at Mrs. Seeley’s,
and showing himself in the streets as little as might be.
This guarded walk brought its own reward. Not once
in his goings and comings did he see a familiar face out
of the disregarded underworld; and when the sense of
security began to tread upon the heels of continued immunity,
he ventured to take another step and went with
Antrim to call upon the Langfords.</p>

<p>“They are nice people, and I am sure you’ll like
them,” said the chief clerk. “My father was the
judge’s oldest friend back in Tennessee, and our houses
stood in the same acre. I’ve known them ever since I
can remember.”</p>

<p>Antrim signalled a North Denver car, and Brant
ventured a single question:</p>

<p>“Large family of them?”</p>

<p>“No; two girls and a boy. Dorothy’s good, but not
pretty; Isabel is pretty, but not—well, I’ll leave her out,
and you can judge for yourself. As for Will, he is another
sort altogether. I call him an unlicked cub.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Antrim was introducing his
friend in the double drawing-room of the transplanted
Southern mansion in the highlands.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Langford—my friend, Mr. Brant. Judge
Langford, this is the hermit I promised to bring you.
Isabel, let me present Mr. Brant. Dorothy——”</p>

<p>But the elder daughter was smiling her remembrance
of him, and she forestalled the introduction.</p>

<p>“I am so glad to be able to thank you in our own
house, Mr. Brant,” she said. “Mamma, this is the
gentleman who was so kind to me on the night of the
wreck.”</p>

<p>That was the beginning of it; and Brant’s heart
warmed within him when he allowed himself to hope
that something more beneficent than chance had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
brought them together again. Later in the evening,
however, it cooled, till the former generous glow became
a mere memory. The chilling process began in a turn
of the conversation which defined Mrs. Langford’s attitude
toward sin and sinners, and her point of view was
that of a mother of marriageable daughters. She had
small charity for sowers of wild oats, and was strongly
in favour of a social code which should embody a goodly
measure of expiation. If every young man were
held strictly accountable—were given to understand
that every misstep would shut one or more respectable
doors to him—the crop of wild oats would grow smaller
with every generation.</p>

<p>Brant went dumb before the suggested accusation,
was ill at ease during the remainder of the evening, and
was much relieved when Antrim finally gave the signal
for departure. On the walk cityward (they had missed
the car) the chief clerk harked back to this discussion
on culpability.</p>

<p>“I could hardly keep a straight face while Mrs.
Langford was laying down the law for us,” he chuckled.
“She has a very dark-brown sheep in her own household—though
she would be the last person in the world
to admit it.”</p>

<p>“So? The son, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Will. He is only nineteen, but I am afraid
he has sounded the pond pretty thoroughly. I haven’t
kept track of him here in Denver, partly because he has
no use for a friend of the family, and partly because I
haven’t much use for him. But he promised to be a
terror when he was only a schoolboy back home, and I
have no doubt he is keeping the promise.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity,” said Brant, thinking of the boy’s elder
sister.</p>

<p>“It’s all of that. There is plenty of good blood in
him on the Langford side, but his mother was a Troop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
and the Troops have had at least one black sheep in
every generation. But the father and mother are to
blame, too. They have had one standard for the daughters
and another for the son. Will has never known
the meaning of obedience, and he has never been required
to do anything he didn’t want to do. Consequently
he is a hardened sinner at nineteen.”</p>

<p>“What is his particular weakness?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that he has any favourites. To the
best of my knowledge he is as impartial as a callow
youth can well be. I’ve heard more about his gambling
than anything else, though.”</p>

<p>“Quiet games with amateurs? or the other kind?”</p>

<p>Antrim laughed. “The other kind, of course.
Penny-ante in a parlour wouldn’t be half tough enough
to suit him.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad.”</p>

<p>“Yes; especially bad in his case. He is a surly
young cub, as vindictive as he is quarrelsome. Somebody
will lay him out one of these fine nights, and that
will be the end of it.”</p>

<p>Brant held his peace for two whole squares; then he
spoke his mind freely as to a friend.</p>

<p>“It is none of my business, Antrim,” he began,
“and I don’t know how you stand with the family,
but it is a thousand pities to let that boy go to the devil
without turning a hand to save him. I don’t half like
the way you put it.”</p>

<p>Antrim laughed again. “You must remember that
while you’re hearing it for the first time, it is an old
story with me. Besides, I shouldn’t have a ghost of a
chance with him. He doesn’t like me, and I don’t like
him. If I should try to interfere I’d simply get myself
into hot water with all concerned.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, something ought to be done,”
Brant insisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“I agree with you, but who is to do it? By Jove,
I have an idea! Suppose you try your hand. Mrs.
Langford wouldn’t thank you a little bit, because she
would never admit the necessity; so far from it, she’d
probably write you down in her black book. But the
judge knows, and he’d be your friend for life.”</p>

<p>Brant smiled rather grimly at the thought of his becoming
a bearwarden for wayward youth, but he answered
not a word; and presently their arrival at Mrs.
Seeley’s put an end to the talk. Contrary to his custom,
Brant did not read himself to sleep that night. In
room of a book he took a problem to bed with him, lying
awake far into the small hours to wrestle therewith.
And the name of the problem was William Langford.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>A MOLEHILL LEVELLED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Brant’s first visit to the transplanted Southern
mansion in the Highlands to the second was but a step,
which he found easier to take after the talk with Antrim
about the black sheep.</p>

<p>After that, finding his welcome all that could be desired,
he went often. The judge liked him because he
took the trouble to inform himself on the subject of penology,
which was the invalid’s hobby; Mrs. Langford
was disposed to be gracious to him because of his kindness
to Dorothy on the train; Isabel openly rejoiced in
the acquisition of a critic who knew the difference between
a work of art and a photograph; and Dorothy
made him welcome for many reasons, most of which she
kept under lock and key in the strong room of her
heart.</p>

<p>So there were not a few excursions across the river
for Brant, and all went well until a certain Tuesday
evening in late September—the Tuesday following that
Sunday of picture measurings and lovers’ partings.
Brant had reached the house in the Highlands rather
later than usual, and found Dorothy alone with her father
and mother. There were unmistakable signs of
sorrow in Dorothy’s eyes; and when neither the judge
nor Mrs. Langford seemed grateful for the company of
their guest, Brant cut his visit short.</p>

<p>When he took his leave Dorothy followed him out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
to the veranda. There had been nothing more than a
pleasant friendship between them thus far, but Brant
had been watching eagerly for a chance to say or do
something which might lessen the distance. Here was
the coveted opportunity; and when she gave him her
hand at parting, with a halting excuse for the gloom
of the household, he made bold to hold it while he said:</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of it unless you want to; but—just
send me about my business if I am intruding—is there
anything I can do to help you?”</p>

<p>“Then you know?” She stopped in tearful embarrassment,
and he was too generous to allow her to
go on.</p>

<p>“I know nothing, and seek to know nothing—that
is, not anything more than you want to tell me. But
you seem to be in trouble.”</p>

<p>“I am; we all are. And there is no reason why you
shouldn’t know; it will be in the papers in the morning,
and then every one will know. Will didn’t come
home last night, and—and father found him in jail this
morning.”</p>

<p>With all his comings and goings, and with all his
good will to know him better, Brant yet knew the black
sheep as little as might be, and that little by hearsay.
The boy was seldom at home in the evening, and on the
few occasions when his homestayings had coincided
with Brant’s visits he had been sullen and reticent,
showing forth the fitness of Antrim’s epithets. Scanty
as were his opportunities for observation, however,
Brant had seen that the mother idolized her son and
found no fault in him; that Isabel tempered her sisterly
affection with a generous measure of contempt; and
that Dorothy loved her brother not blindly, but well.
And it was with Dorothy’s point of view that Brant
chiefly concerned himself.</p>

<p>“Where is he now?” he inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“We don’t know; that is the sharp edge of it. He
was in his room at noon, but when I went to take him
his dinner he was gone.”</p>

<p>“One more question, and you need not answer it if
I ought not to know: What was the trouble last
night?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure, but I think that—that—” she
stumbled over the wording of it and would have broken
down, but Brant ventured a word of comfort and she
went on: “They were playing cards, and the police
took them all. Will has made mamma believe they
were not gambling, but I am afraid that isn’t true.”
She turned away from him to lean against a veranda pillar
to cry softly with her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Brant saw the path of duty very clearly; and he saw,
too, that it might easily lead him straight to his own
undoing. None the less, he set his feet therein like a
man and a lover.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry,” he said. “We must find some way to
help him. Does Antrim know anything about this?”</p>

<p>“No; and that is why Isabel went to the theatre
with him to-night. They had planned to go, and she
knew he would find out if they stayed at home. She
would have had to tell him.”</p>

<p>“That is all I need to know. Now go in and comfort
your father and mother. I can help—perhaps
more than you would be willing to believe. Good
night.”</p>

<p>“One word, Mr. Brant: you will bring him home
if you find him, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. And I’ll find him, if he is in Denver.
Has he a latchkey?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t sit up for him; and don’t let your
mother, if you can help it. And you mustn’t grieve; it
will come out all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Oh, if I could only believe that! But I don’t know
how we can ever repay you, Mr. Brant.”</p>

<p>“Wait till I have done something worthy of payment;
then perhaps I may tell you—if you will let me.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>A car was coming, and he ran to the crossing to intercept
it. Half an hour later he was climbing the
stairs to the editorial rooms of the Colorado Plainsman,
listening to the rumbling of the presses in the basement,
and wondering if his slight acquaintance with the man
he sought would serve his purpose. The night editor
was in, but his desk was yet unlittered.</p>

<p>“Hello, Brant; glad to see you. Sit down. Got a
scoop for us?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” said Brant. Then he took counsel
of directness. “It is rather the other way about. I
want to cut a slice out of one that you have got.”</p>

<p>“Anything in reason. State the case,” said the
editor briefly.</p>

<p>“It is this: the police raided a dive last night, I
believe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Draco’s. It was this morning, though, after
the forms were locked.”</p>

<p>“So I supposed. Well, there is one name that
must come out of the list of arrests—that of William
Langford.”</p>

<p>Editor Forsyth lighted a cigar and tilted his swing
chair to what the night force called the disputatious
angle.</p>

<p>“‘Must’ is a stout word in a newspaper office,” he
objected. “Who is this William Langford? and why
should he play and not pay?”</p>

<p>Brant uncoupled the two queries and spoke only to
the latter.</p>

<p>“There are plenty of reasons. For one, he is only
a boy; for another, he is a friend of mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>The editor chuckled. “You have no business to be
making maps in the colonel’s office,” he retorted.
“You ought to syndicate yourself to the refrigerator
people; they’d save money on their ice bills.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that. Will you do what I want
you to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure.” Forsyth took down the copy hook,
found the report of the raid, and blue-pencilled the
name of William Langford. “It’s rank treason—muzzling
the press, you know—but anything to oblige a
friend. What else can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“Much; this is only the beginning. Put on your
hat and coat and go with me to the other morning
papers. I don’t know any of the newspaper men; but
they will do it for you.”</p>

<p>The chair of the night editor righted itself with a
crash.</p>

<p>“By Jove! Say, Brant, you’ve got the cold nerve
of your namesake over in the Silverette district; I’ll be
hanged if you haven’t. Oh, I’ll go,” he went on. “I
suppose the other fellows will say there is a woman in
the case, and devil me accordingly, but that won’t matter.
Come on, and let’s have it over with.”</p>

<p>“There is a woman in the case,” said Brant calmly.
“Otherwise I shouldn’t be here. But she must not be
mentioned.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Langford is your cousin, and you
are his natural guardian—that’s the line. Light a fresh
cigar and we’ll be about it.”</p>

<p>They made the round of the newspaper offices together,
and when it was completed Brant thanked Forsyth
at the foot of the Plainsman stairway.</p>

<p>“I owe you one, Forsyth, and I’ll pay it when I
can,” he said. “Let me know when the time comes—say
some dark night when you need a bodyguard, for
instance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Forsyth laughed. “I believe you would fill the bill
about as well as the Silverette man. By the way, is he
a relative of yours?”</p>

<p>“No; but I know something of him. Good night.”
And at the word Brant turned away to begin the search
for the lost sheep of the house of Langford.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>AND A MOUNTAIN UPREARED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the night after the raid Draco’s gambling house
was running in full panoply as usual; and thither
Brant directed his steps upon leaving the Plainsman
building. Arguing from experience, he made sure that
young Langford would be found in the kennel of the
dog that had bitten him; and carrying the deduction a
step farther, he was prepared to find the lad playing the
part of led captain to some older villain.</p>

<p>It was not likely that the boy had developed a
passion for play of his own motion. Brant knew that
trade well. It had its master workmen, its slipshod
journeymen, its tramps, and its apprentices. He doubted
not that young Langford was still of the undergraduate
guild; in which case a heroic remedy might yet
effect a cure.</p>

<p>This train of reasoning led to certain conclusions.
If he should find the boy serving as a stool pigeon for
some older man, his task would be comparatively easy.
The professional gambler is sufficiently wise in his own
generation; and a word to the wise—such a word as
Brant knew how to speak—would quickly release the
apprentice.</p>

<p>So much for the boy and the first step in his rescue.
After that it would be the father’s part to keep him
from forming a new alliance—if he could.</p>

<p>For himself, however, Brant foresaw price payings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
of the dearest. The lower world was thickly peopled
in the Denver of that day, and he could scarcely hope to
win in and out unrecognised. As a citizen of that
world his light had not been hidden under a bushel.
He was known to the men of his tribe, and the tribe is
nomadic, albeit it keeps well within its own marches.</p>

<p>What then? Merely this: It would be passed from
lip to ear that Plucky George of the mining camps was
in town; that, for reasons best known to himself, he was
living for the time in retirement. And thereafter he
would better cut off his right hand than be seen in
public with any woman whose reputation he valued.</p>

<p>This was the barb of the arrow, and it rankled sorely
while he was measuring the distance between the Plainsman
building and the kennel of the dog. Nevertheless,
he went on steadily enough until he stood before the
baize doors screening the interior of the Draconian kennel.
But here he hung reluctant for a moment, knowing
that he had reached the turning point. Once beyond
the swinging doors it would be too late to go back.</p>

<p>So he stopped, and put out his hand and withdrew it,
and for the first time in many years the square jaw of
him lacked something of its resolute outline. Within
he could heard the shuffling of feet, the clinking of
glasses, the <i>b-r-r-r</i> of the roulette balls—all the familiar
sounds of the life he had put behind him. He was far
enough away from it now to begin to loathe it; and yet
it drew him irresistibly. What if he should be dragged
back into the old paths again? Stranger things had
happened; and the fascination of the serpent is not less
potent because it is loathsome.</p>

<p>While he hesitated, it came to him like the thrilling
of an electric shock that this was one of the penalties
he would always have to pay—this calling to him of the
underworld to which he had belonged. In a flash of
the inner self-sight, one of those glimpses into heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
possibilities that not even a good man may prolong to
a scrutiny, he saw that he had lied in telling Hobart
that his yearnings were altogether for better things.
They were not. The woundings of the evil years were
not healed, and they might never be. He turned and
took a step away from the doors of peril.</p>

<p>There and then he saw a picture of a grief-stricken
young woman leaning against a vine-covered veranda
pillar and sobbing softly as one who mourns without
hope. Then and there the thought of his promise to
Dorothy Langford nerved him afresh, and the swing
doors fell apart under his hand.</p>

<p>The baize screens were yet winging to rest behind
him, and he had no more than taken the measure
of the place, when the bartender threw up his hand by
way of welcome. Here was recognition on the very
threshold of the undertaking; and since it had come,
Brant set his teeth and determined to make such use of
it as his errand would warrant. So he went around to
the end of the bar and waited until the man was at liberty.
That was not long.</p>

<p>“Well, say, old pardner—shake! I thought you’d
turn up all right. How are they coming, anyhow?
Fellow came in here a while back and said you’d killed
a man up on the range and lit out. I told him he lied;
told him you wasn’t the runaway kind; see? What’ll
you take?”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Brant was but a short Sabbath-day’s
journey away from the associations of which the
bartender’s greeting was a part, he winced at the familiarity
of it, at the oaths with which it was plentifully
garnished, and even at the underworld <i>argot</i> in which
it was couched. Then he humbled himself and put his
newly found dignity under foot.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I am not drinking anything to-night,
Tom. I merely dropped in to ask a question or two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Fire away.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen a young fellow hanging around here
lately—smooth-faced boy, dark eyes and dark hair—dresses
pretty well?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; that’s the kid. He’s here now.”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“Well, hardly; the Professor has sort of adopted
him, I reckon; anyhow, they run together most of the
time.”</p>

<p>Brant’s face flushed as if the man had smitten him,
and with the narrowing of his eyes the past laid fast
hold upon him and once more the man-quelling demon
was in possession.</p>

<p>“There is only one ‘Professor,’ I take it.” He
spoke softly, as one speaks to a little child. “You
mean Jim Harding?”</p>

<p>“Sure; <i>her</i> brother. You ought to know him, if
anybody does.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know him.” The recusant sinner turned
his back to the bar and let his gaze go adrift down the
long room. It was comfortably filled. There were
pairs and trios and quartettes at the card tables; little
groups around the marble games and roulette
boards; a front rank of sitters about the faro table,
with a standing reserve playing over the shoulders
of those in the chairs; and in the midst an uneasy
throng revolving about the various centres of attraction,
like the slow-moving figures in a timeless
minuet.</p>

<p>Somewhere in this devil’s dragnet was the boy—the
boy who was Dorothy’s brother. To keep that in
mind asked for an effort, because with the boy he
should find his enemy, the man who had traded upon
a sister’s shame. At the thought the gray eyes grew
hard and cruel, and his hand went back toward the
bartender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Give me your pistol a minute, Tom; I may need
it,” he said, without looking around.</p>

<p>“It won’t do down here, George. They’d hang you
too quick for any use.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that; give me the gun.”</p>

<p>The weapon was passed across the bar and Brant
dropped it into his coat pocket. Then he dipped into
the uneasy throng and began a search which ended
beside one of the roulette boards. Young Langford
was watching the game dry-lipped and hot-eyed, and
at his side stood a man who might have passed otherwhere
for a schoolmaster. He was tall and slightly
stooping, his garments were of the clerical cut, and his
lean face was clean shaven. Only in the ferrety eyes
was there a hint of the unfathomable wickedness of the
man. The nickname of “the Professor” fitted him
aptly, and he dressed the part, playing it with all the
skill of a trained actor.</p>

<p>To outward appearances no more harmless person
than James Harding could have been met in a day’s
journey; but Brant knew his man. Coming softly up
behind, he seized Harding’s right wrist and held it helpless
while he spoke.</p>

<p>“Excuse yourself to the boy and come out with me,”
he whispered at Harding’s ear; and the vicelike grip
turned the soft-spoken words into a command.</p>

<p>Harding’s answer was a stealthy movement of his
free hand toward his breast pocket, but Brant checked
it with a word.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, or take me for one, unless you
are ready to quit. Do as I tell you, and be quick
about it.”</p>

<p>There was murder in Harding’s eyes what time he
was measuring his chance against the weapon in Brant’s
pocket. Then fear took its place, and he obeyed the
command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“All right,” said the boy, without taking his eyes
from the spinning roulette ball. “I’ll wait here for
you.”</p>

<p>Brant marched his man to the swing doors and out
into the deserted street. Just beyond the circle illuminated
by the arc light in front of Draco’s he backed
Harding to the wall.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” he said briefly.</p>

<p>Harding’s thin lip quivered like that of a snarling
dog, but again he obeyed.</p>

<p>“Turned hold-up, have you, George?” he sneered.</p>

<p>Brant ignored the taunt and deftly disarmed his
captive. Then he spoke tersely and to the point, as
one who may enforce his commands.</p>

<p>“You know me, and there is no need to measure
words. I brought you out here to tell you what you
are to do. You are going to take that boy home and
turn him loose; and then you are going to keep out
of his way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am, am I?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and this is the way you are going to do it:
You will go back in there and bring him out; then you
will walk him up the street and put him into the first
carriage you come to. Do I make myself perfectly
clear?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing! You’ve got it all down to a fine point,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Then you will get in with him and go wherever
the driver takes you. By the time the carriage stops
you will have explained matters in any way you see fit;
only young Langford must be given to understand that
it is all off between you.”</p>

<p>“And after that?”</p>

<p>“After that I think it will be best for you to leave
Denver. It is a fair-sized town, but I am afraid it isn’t
big enough to hold you and me at the same time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“And what if I refuse? What if I tell you to go
to——”</p>

<p>Brant took out the borrowed pistol and balanced it
on the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>“In that case I shall be obliged to make sure of you
here and now; and remembering what you are, I’d about
as soon do it as not.”</p>

<p>The man at bay fought the fear back out of the
telltale eyes and tried to laugh hardily.</p>

<p>“You are a pretty smooth talker, George, but you
can’t bluff me. I don’t know just what you are driving
at, but I do happen to know that you don’t care to get
your name in the papers just now. All the same, I’m
willing to oblige you—for a consideration.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Brant, still balancing the
weapon.</p>

<p>“A hundred, say, in money, and that little package
of papers you took the trouble to have sworn out
against me up in Taggett’s Gulch.”</p>

<p>Brant considered it for a moment, and the man at
bay began to have a dim premonition that he had gone
too far; that his life hung in the balance while he
waited. The terror of it grew with the lagging seconds,
and he had opened his mouth to withdraw the condition
when Brant spoke again:</p>

<p>“You know very well that I don’t have to make
terms with you, but you shall have the money. The
papers I keep. Now go and get the boy, and don’t
make any bad breaks. If you do, I shall shoot first and
talk afterward.”</p>

<p>Harding drew breath of relief and re-entered the
kennel with Brant at his heels. Inside the swing doors
the latter gave another order.</p>

<p>“Go on and get your man; I’ll wait here while you
are doing it.”</p>

<p>When Harding was about it Brant turned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
bartender. “Here is your gun, Tom; much obliged.
And, while I think of it, I’ll turn over the Professor’s
arsenal. You can give it back to him when he calls
for it.”</p>

<p>A murderous-looking knife, a life preserver, and a
set of brass knuckles changed hands, and Deverney
swept them into a drawer with an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“Holy Smut! And he let you catch him without
his gun!” he said.</p>

<p>“Not much,” rejoined Brant pleasantly. “But I
shall keep that for a little while. I am not through
with him yet. And say, Tom, that reminds me: if that
youngster ever comes back here, just pull that ‘No
Minors Allowed’ sign on him and run him out. You
won’t lose anything, because he will have no money to
blow in.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it—for you, George. But the Professor
will run him in again.”</p>

<p>“I shall make it my business to see that he doesn’t,”
Brant asserted; and just then Harding came up with
young Langford.</p>

<p>“Hello, Brant,” said the cub, with a free-and-easy
swagger born of the place rather than of his temperament.
“By gad, I didn’t know you were a
sporting man! Shake hands with my friend Mr. Harding.”</p>

<p>Brant scowled, but the boy saw nothing and rattled
on: “Going home early to-night. What will you take,
gentlemen? It’s on me.”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Brant shortly; and Harding drew
the boy away.</p>

<p>The pair left the place and went up the street, with
Brant a few steps in the rear. At the corner a night-owl
carriage was waiting for a chance fare, and Harding
opened the door and got in with his companion. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the click of the door latch Brant climbed to a seat beside
the driver and gave the order.</p>

<p>“No. 16 Altamont Terrace,” he said; and when
the horses were fairly headed for North Denver he
lighted a cigar and ventured to anticipate success.</p>

<p>But the triumph was short-lived. While the carriage
was yet rumbling over the viaduct the little upflash
of triumph flickered and went out. For, however
worthy the cause in which he had fought and won, it
was Brant the man of violence, and no repentant sinner
of them all, who had done the fighting. For the time
being he had lapsed as thoroughly as if the new leaf
had never been turned, and the dregs of that cup were
bitter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>A BLOW IN THE DARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a careful man blunders he is apt to make
thorough work of it. If Brant had suspected the use
Harding would make of an uninterrupted quarter of an
hour with William Langford, it is safe to assume that
no preventive, however heroic, would have failed to
commend itself to the rescuer; and he should have foreseen.
Any tenderfoot of them all would have been less
blunt-witted, he told himself afterward in much bitterness
of spirit. But that was after the fact. While he
was smoking his cigar on the box and tasting some of
the aloe dregs of the cup of lapsings, Harding was making
the most of his opportunity.</p>

<p>“No, Willie, I can’t say when I may be back in
Denver. A man with a big mine on his hands can’t
play marbles all the time, you know. Has to look after
his ante or they’ll steal him blind.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Will; and then, “Where is
your mine?”</p>

<p>Now one place is as good as another for the location
of purely mythical real estate; but, for safety’s sake,
Harding went far afield.</p>

<p>“It’s on the other side of the range; in the Silverette
district.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Then you must know all about the
Jessica. The governor’s got some stock in the Jessica.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Ye-yes; oh, yes. I know the Jessica, of course.
But the Silverette is a big district, you know. My
claim isn’t anywhere near the camp, and I’m glad
of it. Tough town, is Silverette. And that reminds
me, how did you happen to catch on to George
Brant?”</p>

<p>Truly, Will Langford was a crass young idiot whose
ways were very far from being the ways of wisdom,
and yet he was not besotted enough to be without an
undefined conviction that this smooth-tongued mine
owner of pedagogic appearance and profligate habit was
not a man to whom family affairs could be properly
confided. Wherefore he skirted the question.</p>

<p>“I don’t know very much about him. He is a friend
of a friend of ours.”</p>

<p>“I thought you wasn’t fairly on to him, or you
wouldn’t have introduced me,” said Harding, with
marked significance. “He is a mighty good man to
let alone. You can bet high on that and play to win
every time.”</p>

<p>The hint accomplished that whereunto it was sent,
and Will must needs know more. Harding was crafty
enough to make an unspeakable mystery of it until the
boy’s curiosity was whetted to the keen edge of demanding
the particulars for family reasons. Then
Harding told Brant’s story, carefully suppressing his
own connection therewith, and weaving evil deeds and
worse motives into the narrative with such a skilful
admixture of truth as to make it utterly impossible for
the ex-reprobate ever to clear himself without denying
much that was manifestly undeniable.</p>

<p>The carriage was turning into Altamont Terrace
when he concluded, and the eager listener had time for
no more than a word of thanks.</p>

<p>“By Jove, I’m awfully glad you told me about him,
Mr. Harding! There are reasons, family reasons, as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
said; but I can’t tell you about them now. By gad, if
he ever shows up here again I’ll——”</p>

<p>What the self-constituted guardian of the Langford
honour would do is not to be here set down, since the
carriage was stopping at the gate. Harding would
have given much to know that, and many other things;
would have purchased another quarter of an hour with
the boy at any reasonable price. But with the carriage
drawn up before the judge’s gate and Brant sitting on
the box, the time was unpropitious. So Harding was
fain to bury his desire for further knowledge under a
final word of caution.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I happened to mention it. Keep your
eye on him and give him the whole sidewalk. I saw
him hanging around down yonder, and I was afraid he
might get his hands on you; that’s why I brought you
home. Good night.”</p>

<p>Brant heard the last word, and saw the boy go up
the walk and let himself into the house. Then he gave
the driver the return order.</p>

<p>“Back to town,” he said. “You can put us down
at Elitch’s.”</p>

<p>The long drive back to town was full of disquieting
reflections for the man who desired nothing so much as
to be allowed to atone for past violence by present and
future good behaviour, and who was yet constrained
to play the ruffler through still another interview with
James Harding. Such reflections capped by such consequences
are likely to be heart-hardening, and Brant
was in no merciful mood when the carriage drew up at
the curb in front of the <i>café</i> and he climbed down to
open the door.</p>

<p>“Come out,” he rasped; and when Harding stood
beside him, “You will have to go in here with me to
get your money.”</p>

<p>Harding nodded, and threw in a sneer. “Banking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
with John nowadays, are you?” But to this Brant
made no reply.</p>

<p>As it chanced, the great dining room was nearly
empty, and the genial proprietor, known and loved of
all men, was at his desk. Brant took him aside.</p>

<p>“John, I want a hundred dollars to use right now.
Can you cash a check for me?”</p>

<p>The genial one laughed. It was not his way to cash
checks for men whom he knew and trusted.</p>

<p>“Not much,” he said. “You can have the century,
but I don’t want your paper.” And he found the money
in the little safe behind the desk. “Anything else I can
do for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I want to use one of the private rooms for
a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Elitch held up a finger for the head waiter, a stalwart
young fellow who looked as if he might be a
college athlete working his way through a lean vacation.</p>

<p>“Parker, show these gentlemen to No. 4, and light
the gas for them. No orders.”</p>

<p>The athletic one led the way to a small private dining
room partitioned off in the rear of the public tables.
It was a mere box, lighted by a chandelier pendent from
the ceiling, and furnished only with table and chairs.
When they were alone, Harding dropped into one of
the chairs and Brant drew up another on the opposite
side of the table.</p>

<p>“Now, then, talk quick and tell the truth—if you
can. What did you say to the boy?”</p>

<p>The soul of the real James Harding peered out
through his half-closed eyes for a fleeting instant, but
the veil was drawn again before one might note the
levin-flash of triumph.</p>

<p>“I did what you wanted me to: told him I’d got to
go and look after my mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“What excuse did you make for taking him home?”</p>

<p>“Told him he shouldn’t ought to be out so late.
He’ll do anything for me, that young fellow will.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is very evident,” Brant commented dryly.
Then, “What else did you say to him?”</p>

<p>Again the levin-flash of triumph, but Brant did not
see it. “Nothing; you didn’t tell me to say anything
else to him.”</p>

<p>“No more I didn’t. Well, all you have to do now
is to keep out of his way—and mine. Here is your
money. Take it and make yourself scarce.”</p>

<p>The roll of bills changed hands, and Harding made
sure of the price before he spoke again. Then he
squared himself against his side of the table and asked
if he might have his weapons.</p>

<p>“Deverney has them—all but the gun. I think I
shall keep that as a souvenir.”</p>

<p>Harding nodded assent, and the shifty eyes were
veiled. “That’s all right; keep it, and welcome. I’d
have made you a present of it if you had asked me
for it.” He was picking nervously at the tablecloth,
and a curious change—a change in which sullen hardihood
gave place to something not so easily definable—came
over him as he went on: “And about young
Langford: I would have turned him loose long ago if
I had known you wanted me to; honest to God, I would!
You have had it in for me for a good many years,
George, but there hasn’t been a day in any one of them
when I wouldn’t do anything you asked—and more.”</p>

<p>Brant’s acknowledgment of all this was a contemptuous
curl of the lip, and Harding tried again.</p>

<p>“It’s so, and you know it. We’ve scrapped a good
deal, first and last, but if I’ve been the jackal, you’ve
been the wolf. I’ve been thinking a good bit in the last
hour or so, and I’m going to say what’s in me. Why
can’t we quit square, for once? I haven’t got anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
against you; and it seems like after what has happened
you ought to be willing to let up on me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it does, does it?” Brant was looking now,
and he saw the fear signals flying in the shifty eyes.
He was as yet no more than a catechumen in the temple
of mercy, as he was learning to his cost, and the man-quelling
demon was once more in possession. So he
backslid promptly into the prerepentant barbarism and
gave another twist to the thumbscrews. “That means
that you want something more, I suppose. What is it?
Out with it.”</p>

<p>“The papers, George—the affidavits you got against
me up in Taggett’s Gulch. I haven’t had a good night’s
rest since I found out you had ’em, so help me God, I
haven’t! Wherever I go, and whatever I do, I can feel
that cursed hangman’s knot pulling up under my ear.
For Christ’s sake, give ’em to me, George! Don’t send
me to hell before my time!”</p>

<p>Truly, Brant was yet very far from sainthood, either
in act or intention, since he could look unmoved upon
the ghastly face of the terror-sick man across the table.
Harding leaned forward until his chin was nearly touching
the cloth. His shifty eyes were for once fixed and
glassy, and the perspiration of fear stood thickly upon
his narrow brow. And with the dropping of the mask
of self-control, the old age of dissipation wrought its
will on the clean-shaven face, furrowing it with wrinkles
that seemed to deepen visibly with the dragging seconds.</p>

<p>“Oh, my God! think of it, George,” he began again
in a husky whisper, “think of what would happen if
you were to die! And I’d never get so much as a hint of
what was coming till they had snapped the bracelets on
me! You couldn’t die easy with such a thing as that
on your mind; now could you, George?”</p>

<p>Brant looked away and shut his hands until the
finger nails bit the flesh. There was a moment of silence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
surcharged with the electricity of portent—a moment
in which the limp figure at the opposite side of
the table drew itself up by imperceptible degrees and
the glassy eyes of it began to glow with the fires of unrecking
ferocity. The athletic young head waiter,
drawn to the door of No. 4 by what promptings of
curiosity he knew not, had his eye glued to a crack in
the panel and his ears strained to catch the reply to
Harding’s appeal; and knowing nothing of the man,
but much of the danger signals readable in the man’s
face, he wondered at Brant’s preoccupation. And
when Brant began to speak without looking up, the athlete
swore softly to himself, and cautiously tried the
handle of the door—tried it and found it locked.</p>

<p>“I have thought about that a good many times, and
it has been a comfort to me. You called me a wolf a
minute ago, but it is you who have lived the wolf’s life,
sparing neither man, woman, nor child. Hence it is fitting
that you should die as you have lived. Remembering
these things, and how you used to wring my soul
when you had the power, I think I shall die quite comfortably
when my time comes.”</p>

<p>“Then die!” yelled the madman, hurling himself
in a fierce tiger spring across the table at his tormentor.</p>

<p>Brant was by far the stronger of the twain, but the
onset was so sudden and unexpected that he was borne
down among the chairs, and Harding’s fingers were at
his throat before he could gather himself in defense.
After that he was helpless, and the dancing gas jets of
the chandelier were about to go out in a flare of red
lightning when the weight was lifted from his chest
and he began to breathe again. Then he saw that the
athletic waiter had set his shoulder to the door at the
opportune moment; that he had flung Harding into a
corner and was standing guard over him with a chair
for a weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Say the word, Mr. Brant, and I’ll smash him one
for good luck,” he said; but Brant sat up and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“No; let him go,” he said huskily. “I can kill him
later on if I need to.”</p>

<p>The young man stood aside, and Harding ran out.
Then the athletic one helped Brant to his feet.</p>

<p>“He didn’t cut you, did he?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. I believe he was trying to choke me. I don’t
know how I came to be so careless. How did you happen
in?”</p>

<p>The young man laughed, and was not beyond blushing
a little. “I guess I might as well make a clean
breast of it. Business isn’t very brisk at this time of
night, and I overheard a little of what was going on—not
much, but enough to make me wonder if I could
smash the door in if the need arose. I suppose I ought
to be ashamed of myself; but it was rather lucky, as it
turned out.”</p>

<p>“Very lucky, indeed. And there was nothing particularly
private about my part of the interview. Has
John gone home?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Shall I call a cab for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Give me your shoulder to the sidewalk
and I can make it all right. But I am beginning to
think I had a rather close call.”</p>

<p>“You did that.” The head waiter took Brant’s
arm, and the course between the tables of the public
room was safely steered. At the door the breath of the
night air was revivifying, and Brant found speech in
which to thank his rescuer.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” laughed the athlete. “It’s
all in a day’s work. Good night.”</p>

<small>THE EYE TO THE STRING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Langford household the judge and Dorothy
were the only early risers, and on the morning following
Will’s home-bringing they breakfasted alone together as
usual. Dorothy and her mother had sat up for the wayward
one the night before; but at the breakfast table
the daughter saw that the news of his son’s return
brought small comfort to her father. The cause of his
disquietude was not far to seek. The morning papers
lay unopened beside his plate, and he left them there
when he retreated to the library.</p>

<p>Being a woman, Dorothy did not thus deny herself
the luxury of suffering with full knowledge. She
opened the papers and read the reports of the raid on
Draco’s; and she did not fail to put up a little pæan
of thanksgiving when she found that her brother’s name
was omitted in the list of the arrests. Stopping only
long enough to make assurance doubly sure, she hastened
to the library.</p>

<p>“Here are the papers, father,” she began, and when
he looked up from his book and shook his head in refusal,
she went on quickly: “You needn’t be afraid to
read them; Will’s name isn’t mentioned.”</p>

<p>The judge took the papers and scanned them with
interest newly aroused. The fine old face of the master
of Hollywood, with its heavy white mustache and
pointed goatee, was military rather than judicial, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Dorothy was joyed to see the lines of stern sorrow soften
a little as he read.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said, after he had scanned
the list of the incriminated ones. “Let us thank God
that we are spared so much. But I don’t understand
it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Will gave an assumed name,” Dorothy
suggested.</p>

<p>“And so added a lie to his other misdoings?” rejoined
the father bitterly. “No, he didn’t do that.
I saw the record at the police station.”</p>

<p>Dorothy was puzzled for a moment, and then a light
broke in upon her.</p>

<p>“I think I know how it happened,” she said, and
then she gave him a brief summary of the talk with
Brant on the veranda.</p>

<p>The judge heard her through, and being in nowise
less shrewd because he happened to be his daughter’s
father, he was at no loss to account for Brant’s motive.
Nevertheless, he did not forget to be grateful, and he
gave the helpful one his just meed of praise.</p>

<p>“It was a thoughtful thing to do, and the man who
would think of it at such a time must know how it
grinds to have a good old name dragged in the mire,” he
said warmly. “I shall remember it. Was Mr. Brant
with Will when he came home?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell. I saw the carriage drive up, and
saw Will stop to speak to some one inside after he got
out. Then he came up the walk alone, and the carriage
went back toward the boulevard.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was a kindly deed, well meant and well
done, and we are Mr. Brant’s poor debtors,” said the
judge, taking up one of the papers again. “I shall go
down by and by and thank him for it.”</p>

<p>Dorothy went at that, and when the library door
closed behind her the judge put the paper down, ostensibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
to polish his eyeglasses, but really because the
problem of his old age had grown great enough to banish
interest in everything else. He had always prided
himself on being a good judge of human nature, and so
he was when the point of view was the judge’s bench in
a courtroom. But it is a wise father who knows his
own son; and Judge Langford was just beginning to
suspect that his experience with human nature, and his
courtroom studies therein, had counted for little in the
training of his son. More than this, he was coming to
understand that there is a time when a father’s lost opportunities
may not be regained; that the saving of
William Langford, if salvage there were to be, must be
at other and alien hands.</p>

<p>That conclusion set him upon the search for his own
substitute, and most naturally he thought of Brant.
There was that about Colonel Bowran’s assistant which
made him easily a beau ideal for a younger man whose
tastes were not wholly vitiated. He was a man of
the world—a much wider world than his present position
with the colonel bespoke, the judge decided;
and he was of the masterful type out of which boys are
most likely to fashion their heroes. If the thing might
only come about without suggestion; if— But there
were too many “if’s” in the way, and the judge fell to
polishing his eyeglasses again, letting the summing up
of the matter slip into spoken words: “I wish he might
be able to tell me what to do with the boy. It is far
enough beyond me.”</p>

<p>The door had opened noiselessly, and the mother of
the problem crossed the threshold in good time to overhear
the summing up.</p>

<p>“What is beyond you?” she asked, knowing well
enough what the answer would be.</p>

<p>“The one thing that is always beyond me, Martha—what
we are to do with William.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>The mother had not yet been to breakfast, but she
sat down and prepared to argue her son’s case.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it sometimes occur to you that possibly
you may try to do too much?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the judge firmly, knowing by sorrowful
experience whereunto the argument would lead. “By
some means—I don’t pretend to know how—the boy always
manages to whitewash himself with you. But I
am coming to know him better. We may as well face
the fact first as last, Martha. He is thoroughly, utterly,
recklessly bad. God forgive me that I should have it to
say of the son for whom I am responsible!”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Langford protested indignantly, as was her
maternal privilege.</p>

<p>“That is just where you are mistaken—in assuming
that he is bad at heart. You don’t understand him at
all, and sometimes I’m tempted to think you don’t want
to. Are there no allowances to be made for youthful
thoughtlessness?”</p>

<p>“Youthful depravity, you would better say.” The
judge left his chair and began to walk the floor. “Why
don’t you call things by their right names? I should
think this last affair would open your eyes, if nothing
else has.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Please sit down, Robert; you
make me nervous. I had a long talk with him last
night, and he told me everything without reserve. I
know it was all wrong—his being in such a place—but
it was rather foolish than intentionally wicked.”</p>

<p>“You make a nice distinction,” said the judge, but
the sorrow in his voice dulled the edge of the sarcasm.
“What is his story?”</p>

<p>“Why, just this. It seems that he has a friend—a
Mr. Harding, a wealthy mine owner—and they went
around together to see the sights, purely out of curiosity,
William says, and I believe him. They just happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
to be in this Draco place night before last; and
when the police rushed in they took everybody, guilty
and innocent. William says his friend tried to explain
that they were only onlookers, but it was no use, and—well,
we know the rest.”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather better than I could wish. As a result
of his curiosity, or this Mr. Harding’s, I find my
son in the police station, charged with gambling.”</p>

<p>“Of course, in such a case the charge would be
made against everybody.”</p>

<p>“As it should be. If William had been at home, instead
of prowling about town with a disreputable companion——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langford raised deprecatory hands.</p>

<p>“Wait and hear the sequel before you do the man
an injustice. When Will went downtown last night,
feeling desperate and discouraged enough to do anything,
this Mr. Harding found him and insisted on his
coming straight home—brought him home in a carriage,
in fact. A bad man would not have done that.”</p>

<p>The judge looked perplexed, as well he might.
“Brought him home in a carriage, you say? Why, I
thought—” But he did not add what he thought.</p>

<p>“Yes, and that wasn’t all. It seems that Mr. Harding
knows Mr. Brant, and he told William his whole
history. Will wouldn’t repeat it—he said it wasn’t fit
for me to hear—but he told me enough so that I shall
know what to say to Mr. Brant if he ever has the effrontery
to come here again.”</p>

<p>Here was a fresh mystery, but the judge was wise
enough not to repeat what Dorothy had told him.
Moreover, he knew his son’s failings too well to place
implicit confidence in any story of his told in a peace-making
moment after an escapade. Wherefore he
counselled moderation.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t take too much for granted if I were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
you, Martha,” he said. “There are always two sides
to an accusation like that, and possibly Mr. Brant may
have something to say for himself. Anyway, I should
give him a chance.”</p>

<p>“That is precisely what I shall do,” Mrs. Langford
rejoined, with a tightening of the firm lips that boded ill
for the man who was to be given the chance; after
which she went to breakfast, leaving her husband to
the company of his own thoughts—thoughts which were
far from comforting.</p>

<p>How much of William’s story could be believed?
And who was this man Harding who claimed to know
Brant? If the latter was the one who had prevailed
upon Will to come home, how was it that the boy had
come in a carriage with the former? And which of the
two had suppressed the mention of William Langford’s
name in the published lists of the accused? These and
many more perplexing questions suggested themselves,
and the judge was no nearer the heart of the tangle
when he finally went out to seek Brant at the railway
offices.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE STRING TO THE SHAFT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for Brant, the day following the retrieval of the
body of William Langford was a day to be marked in the
calendar as the Feast of the Mingled Cups. Having
been up rather more than half the night, he was a little
late at the office, and he found the chief engineer getting
ready to go up the line on the day train.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Brant,” said the colonel. “You
are just in time. I want Grotter’s field notes to take
with me. What did you do with the book?”</p>

<p>Brant found the notebook, and began to say something
about late hours and their next morning consequences,
but the colonel only laughed good-naturedly:</p>

<p>“I know; I was a young man once myself. But if
I had it to do over again I’d touch it lightly. Of course,
you are new to the West, and naturally you want to see
the animals; but even an onlooker has to be careful
and not get the smell of the menagerie in his clothes.
It’s devilish hard to get out.”</p>

<p>It was a random thrust, but it went home, and for a
few minutes after the colonel’s departure Brant saw
only the large humour of it. Truly, he had never posed
before his chief as a reformed reprobate; but to be mistaken
for an innocent youth, fresh from the moral environment
of the well-behaved East, was mirth for the
gods. Afterward, however, the pendulum swung to the
opposite end of its arc. Was it quite honest that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
should suffer the colonel—and others—to think better
of him than the facts warranted? Obtaining money
under false pretences was a crime: was it any less culpable
to carry off booty of good repute in like manner?</p>

<p>As far as his chief was concerned, Brant had come
to know the colonel well enough to be sure that a most
intimate knowledge of the incriminating facts would
have little weight with him on the professional side.
He was well satisfied with his assistant, and, unlike
many employers, he was frank enough to say so. But
there was a standing invitation—as yet unused—holding
the door of the Bowran home open to the draughtsman.
This might not be withdrawn in so many words,
but—Brant put himself in the colonel’s shoes—it would
probably not be renewed.</p>

<p>From the Bowran generalities to the Langford particulars
was but a step, and Brant presently began to ask
himself curious questions touching the continuance of
his welcome at Hollywood if the facts were known.
That was a different matter, and he was not long in
arriving at conclusions definite and humiliating. The
judge would probably set him down as a hypocrite; Mrs.
Langford would be horrified; Isabel would want him to
pose as the central figure in a certain picture of mining
camp life she was painting; Will would fellowship him
frankly on the ground of similarity of tastes; and Dorothy—it
was not so easy to prefigure her attitude, though
pity and sorrow for a smashed ideal might well be the
pointing of it.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” said this latter-day flagellant,
scourging himself into a fine fury of self-abnegation.
“I go there no more. It is only a question of time
when they will find me out, and then I should do something
desperate.”</p>

<p>So he affected to consider the determination taken
once for all, and fell to work in a dull rage of resentment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
But when that fire burned out for lack of fuel,
as all fires will, another and a holier was kindled in its
place. At thirty a man does not fall in love at first
sight, and in the beginning Dorothy Langford had
figured in his thoughts of her only as an incarnation of
pure womanhood. But latterly the point of view had
been changing. She was no longer a type; she was the
eidolon of the type. Brant asked himself a blunt question,
and the ink dried between the nibs of his ruling
pen while the question waited for its answer. The windows
of the map room looked northward, and he got
down from the high stool to stand with his hands behind
him, gazing abstractedly across the railway yards
toward the quarter of the town he had come to know
best.</p>

<p>“You have spun the web for me, little girl, and I
couldn’t break away from you now if the heavens fall,”
he said, letting his thought slip into speech. “I have
just about one chance in a hundred of being able to
carry it off without being found out, and I am going
to take that chance; I’d take it if it were only one in a
thousand.”</p>

<p>The outer office door opened and shut, but Brant
heard it not. For which cause he started guiltily when
some one behind him said:</p>

<p>“You have a fine view from here, Mr. Brant.”</p>

<p>Brant spun around as one shot, and found himself
confronting the father of the young woman whom he
had been apostrophizing. For a moment even the commonplaces
deserted him, but presently he recovered
himself sufficiently to join rather sheepishly in the
laugh at his own expense.</p>

<p>“I was fairly caught,” he admitted. “How long
have you been here?”</p>

<p>“Not long enough to hear any secrets,” replied the
judge. “You were saying something about ‘one in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
thousand’ when I came in, and it struck me as being
a very natural remark for a young man in a trance.”</p>

<p>“It is one of my bad habits,” Brant confessed—“talking
to myself, I mean. It began when I was a
little fellow and lacked playmates.”</p>

<p>“It is a very common habit. I once knew an attorney
who had it in a most peculiar form. His office was
adjoining mine, and he would lock the door and discuss
a case with himself. We used to laugh at him a good
bit, but he was always the best-prepared man in court.”</p>

<p>All of which was quite beside the mark, as Brant
well knew; but he made courteous answer, having it
in mind to let his visitor pick his own way through the
generalities. This the judge seemed to find very difficult,
since he made several false starts before coming
finally to the object of his visit. Brant set the hesitancy
down to pardonable family pride, and stood ready
to help when he should be given the chance. At length
the judge came to the point and waded reluctantly into
the domestic pool.</p>

<p>“I came down to thank you for what you did for us
last night, Mr. Brant. My daughter has told me the
circumstances, and it was exceedingly good of you to
interest yourself in my poor boy.”</p>

<p>Brant said “Not at all,” meaning thereby that the
service had been freely rendered, and the judge
went on:</p>

<p>“It was a great relief to us all to find William safe
at home this morning. He left us in anger, and I feel
quite sure that we have you to thank for his return,
though I am wholly in the dark as to how you managed
it.”</p>

<p>Brant answered the implied question frankly.</p>

<p>“It was a very simple matter. I found your son in
company with a man whose influence over him seems to
be quite as great as it is sure to be bad. I happened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
know this man, and I persuaded him to take the boy
home.”</p>

<p>The judge leaned back in his chair and matched
his finger ends reflectively. “William mentions a Mr.
Harding as having accompanied him home in a carriage.
Is he the man?”</p>

<p>Brant bowed.</p>

<p>“Then the boy must be very much mistaken in his
estimate of Harding. He seems to think he is a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that in the least. Harding has probably
been at some pains to make him think so. Just
the same, you may believe me when I say that he is
the worst possible companion for your son, or for any
young man.”</p>

<p>“H’m; that is a little odd.” The judge was fairly
surprised into saying so much, but since he did not go
on, how was Brant to know that the odd thing was the
exact coincidence of his opinion of Harding and Harding’s
opinion of him as reported by William Langford?
And not knowing this, he went on straightway to his
own undoing.</p>

<p>“Odd that he should try to mislead your son?
Knowing the man and his kind as well as I do, I should
say that any other proceeding on his part would be odd.
Harding is a professional gambler.”</p>

<p>The judge began to put two and two together.</p>

<p>“You say you know him well?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have known him a long time, and I owe
him an ill turn or so on my own account,” said Brant,
whose throat still ached from the pressure of Harding’s
fingers.</p>

<p>“Ah.” The judge’s mind began to lay hold of
something like a sequence of threads in the mystery
tangle. “Pardon me, Mr. Brant, if I am dull: but
what possible use could a professional gambler make of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
my son? Surely William’s pocket money would be
scarcely worth plotting for.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Harding would be much more
likely to give him money than to take it from him.
Here is the layout,” Brant went on, dropping unconsciously
into the jargon of the craft in describing its
processes; “Harding poses, let us say, as a gentleman
of leisure. He lays siege to some tenderfoot with more
money than brains, perhaps, but who isn’t altogether
blind, and proposes a quiet game for amusement. If
he worked it alone the rawest greenhorn of the lot
might suspect a trap, but with your son as a third party
the thing looks perfectly square. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>The judge rose and walked slowly the length of the
room with his hands behind him and his head bowed.
When he looked up again the paternal anxiety in his
face had given place to judicial severity.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see two things: One is, that you have a
much worse opinion of my son than the facts, bad as
they are, justify; and the other is, that you seem to have
a—an unenviable familiarity with the methods you have
been describing.”</p>

<p>Brant saw his error when it was too late, and tried to
retrieve it.</p>

<p>“Don’t mistake me, Judge Langford. In such a
case as I have been describing an inexperienced boy
might well be an innocent accomplice—indeed, he
would have to be to be of any use to his principal. And
as to my knowledge, one learns much in the rough
school of the frontier.”</p>

<p>The judge’s hand was on the doorknob.</p>

<p>“I can believe that; pardon me if I spoke hastily,”
he said. “To be very frank with you, I am in deep
trouble about William. If what you tell me about this
man Harding be true, the boy is ruined.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” Brant amended. “Harding has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
left the city; and if you can keep your son from forming
another such intimacy——”</p>

<p>“How do you know Harding is gone?” interrupted
the father.</p>

<p>“He went at my suggestion.”</p>

<p>“And was it also at your suggestion that the newspapers
omitted my son’s name in reporting a certain
wholesale arrest made by the police night before last?”</p>

<p>“It was.”</p>

<p>The judge smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“You seem to be all-powerful, Mr. Brant, but I dislike
mysteries—even beneficent mysteries. In this
matter, however, I am your debtor; let me know when I
may square the account.” And before Brant could add
another word in explanation or extenuation he was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>AND THE SHAFT TO THE MARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> until he had passed the judge’s questions and
his own answers twice or thrice in mental review did
Brant realize how completely he had succeeded in raising
doubts as to his own obviousness where he fain
would have allayed them. Then he grew angry, at his
own inaptness in particular, and at an unsympathetic
world in general. In its turn the fit of wrath was supplanted
by a fever of impatience, and this glowed fitfully
through the interminable afternoon which separated
him from a possible visit to Hollywood.</p>

<p>Having done a good deed, he had a very human hunger
for appreciation—appreciation untinctured by suspicion
or innuendo, and Dorothy, at least, would not
withhold it. So he believed, and, when evening came,
lost no time in presenting himself at the door of the
comfortable mansion in Altamont Terrace.</p>

<p>He was shown into the double drawing-room, and it
was untenanted—a fact remarkable enough to make
him wonder. He had come to know the family habit
well, and after dinner, when it was too cool to sit on the
veranda, at least four of the five would be found in the
living rooms. Was he too early? He looked at his
watch. No; it was a full hour a-past the Langford dinner
time. In the midst of his wonderings the door
opened to admit, not Dorothy or Isabel, but Mrs. Langford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“You must excuse me if I have kept you waiting,”
said the lady in the tone which turns the apology into a
chilly conventionalism. “I was not expecting any one
so early. Is there anything I can do for you, Mr.
Brant?”</p>

<p>Brant doubted his ears, and glanced around involuntarily
as one who has stumbled into the wrong
house.</p>

<p>“I—do for me? Why, nothing in particular,” he
stammered. “Are—are the young ladies at home?”</p>

<p>“Not to you, Mr. Brant; nor will they be if you
should ever happen to call again.”</p>

<p>Brant laid fast hold of his sanity and fought for
calm speech.</p>

<p>“But, Mrs. Langford,” he gasped, “I—I don’t
understand. What have I done?”</p>

<p>“Rather ask what you have not done,” said the lady
icily. “But since you put the question, I may answer
it. You have come here, not once, but many times,
knowing very well that if your history had been known
to us or to Mr. Antrim our doors would never have been
opened to you. If that is not sufficient, I can be still
more explicit, if you wish it.”</p>

<p>“By Heaven, madam, I do wish it!” Brant exploded,
rushing upon his fate like any fool of them all.
But anger was fast supplanting astonishment.</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. Would you mind telling me where
you have spent the better part of your life since you left
college?”</p>

<p>“In the mining camps.” He had a sharp premonition
of what was coming.</p>

<p>“And your occupation was——”</p>

<p>“It was not what it should have been, I admit. But
is there no room for repentance in your creed, Mrs.
Langford?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly; but you have not repented. That is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
proved by your own act in coming here quite as much
as by anything that Mr. Harding says of you.”</p>

<p>“Harding!” At the mention of the name Brant
saw what his enemy had done and went mad accordingly.
“Do you mean to say you would listen for a
moment to anything that damnable hound could say of
me, or of any one?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langford retreated to the door.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Mr. Brant, if I leave you—you are
merely making a bad matter worse. A gentleman does
not so far forget himself as to swear in the presence of
a lady. I think we understand each other, and I will
bid you good evening.”</p>

<p>When she was gone Brant found his way out of the
house, and spent half the night tramping the hills to the
westward of the suburb. Under favouring conditions
self-respect is a plant of rapid growth, but it is sensitive
in inverse proportion to its age. While he was very
willing to call himself the chief of sinners, and to deprecate
his own temerity in aspiring to a seat at the table
of virtue, Brant was no more complaisant under reproach
than any Pharisee of us all.</p>

<p>For this cause he filled the hours of the solitary walk
afield with bitter revilings heaped upon uncharity in
general, and upon social canons as interpreted by the
Mrs. Langfords in particular, going finally to his room
in a frame of mind in which wrath and desperation far
outran grief.</p>

<p>“‘Give a dog a bad name,’” he fumed, flinging hat
and overcoat into a corner and lighting the gas and a
fresh cigar with the same match. “I might have
known what it would come to. And all I asked in the
wide world was to be let alone!”</p>

<small>THE WAY OF A MAID WITH A MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A fortnight</span> or such a matter after his rebuff in the
presence of outraged art—typified by the newly finished
“Sunset in Platte Cañon”—and a week after the Draconian
episode and Brant’s dismissal by Mrs. Langford,
Antrim took Isabel to the opera, meaning to have his
answer once for all before he slept.</p>

<p>Another man under similar hard conditions might
have hesitated to preface his <i>coup de grace</i> matrimonial
with an evening’s amusement; but Antrim was wise in
his generation, and he knew Isabel’s leanings well
enough to be sure that no other preliminary would add
more to his chances of success.</p>

<p>Now <i>Rigoletto</i>, well sung, is a treat not to be despised
even by a jaded theatregoer, and the younger
Miss Langford was neither jaded nor lacking the artistic
sense which finds its complement in good music.
Wherefore she gave a little sigh of regret when the curtain
ran down on the last act, and stood up mechanically
in her place that Antrim might adjust her wrap.</p>

<p>“Great show, wasn’t it?” he said, making a praise-worthy
but purely manlike effort to strike the proper
note of appreciation.</p>

<p>She did not respond, and when they came out in the
lighted foyer he saw the rapt isolation of her mood
and resented it.</p>

<p>“Up on top of the mountain as usual, aren’t you?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Did you happen to come down far enough any time during
the evening to think of the thing as a play meant
to amuse people?” He tried to say it jestingly, but
the whetstone of sarcasm sharpened the words in spite
of the placable intention.</p>

<p>“Don’t tease me, please, Harry; at least, not now
while I’m in the seventh heaven of the aftermath. I’ll
talk practical things with you by and by, if you like,
but just now it would be sacrilege.”</p>

<p>Ordinarily Antrim would have laughed, as he was
wont to laugh at her extravagances. As it was, he
sulked and was silent while they were drifting with the
slow-moving human glacier out through the vestibule
and during the long street-car ride over to the Highlands.</p>

<p>Since early morning he had been fighting a desperate
battle with the Apollyon who disputes the way with
that man who is foolish enough to set the day and hour
in which a question of moment is to be decided. No
sooner had he written it down that Isabel should that
evening be brought to hear reason, than an imp of disorder
came and sat at his elbow, and after this the business
of his office went awry and the day became a lengthened
misery.</p>

<p>He had quarrelled with his stenographer, found fault
with the operator, and made life burdensome for the
office boy. Last, and worst of all, just before the day’s
end he had fallen into a wrangle over the wires with the
division train despatcher at Lone Pine Junction, the
upshot of which was to bring the man’s resignation,
garnished with a few terse “wire” oaths, clicking back
through the sounder in the superintendent’s office.</p>

<p>So much for the day’s tribulations. But since he
had not taken the trouble to tell her, Isabel knew
naught of these things. Hence it was not until they
had left the car and were nearing the Hollywood gate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
that she began to wonder if his silence were altogether
of abstraction.</p>

<p>“You are in a sweet temper to-night, aren’t you,
Harry?” she said, merely by way of arousing him to a
sense of the social part of his duty.</p>

<p>Antrim helped her across the bank-full irrigation
ditch at the curb and answered not a word.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are just aching to take it out on
somebody,” she went on. “If that is the case, you may
begin on me. I’m young and strong, and not too thin-skinned.”</p>

<p>Still Antrim held his peace, fearing to open his
mouth lest a worse thing should come of it.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say something? You needn’t go
into your shell like a disappointed turtle just because
I wouldn’t let you spoil my negative of the opera before
I could get it developed.”</p>

<p>Still no reply.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, Harry, dear? Have
you lost your tongue?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ve been waiting till you saw fit to come
down out of the clouds; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have arrived. And I am ready to forgive
you for being so sulky. My, oh!”</p>

<p>They had reached the gate, and Antrim tried to
open it. The latch stuck, and straightway the gate flew
across the sidewalk bereft of its hinges. Isabel laughed
joyously, and the small explosion served to clear the
moral atmosphere, as other wooden profanities are
said to.</p>

<p>“Good as a play, isn’t it?” growled the young man,
and he sought to re-establish the wrecked gate.</p>

<p>“Ever so much better,” was the quick retort. “It
was positively the most human thing I ever saw you do.
You are always so self-contained and precise that you
put a quick-tempered mortal like me to shame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Did you ever do anything as senseless as this?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I? Come into the house and I’ll show
you.”</p>

<p>He followed her obediently and stood in the dark
hall while she lighted the lamp in her studio. When he
joined her she was running over a stack of canvases
standing in a corner.</p>

<p>“Do you see that?” she asked, slipping out one of
the oil studies and giving it to him.</p>

<p>It was a sketchy little painting of Long’s Peak, and
it was punctured with numberless penknife stabs.</p>

<p>“I did that one day when I was particularly savage,”
she confessed; “just as you were when you smashed the
gate. You don’t know how much good it does me to
find out now and then that I haven’t a monopoly of all
the bad temper in the world.”</p>

<p>Antrim grinned. “Don’t lose any sleep on that
score; you have lots of good company. I have been
having a tough time of it all day, and the gate business
was only the wind-up.”</p>

<p>“Poor old martyr! And I have been sticking pins
into it all evening! What has been the trouble? Or
is it tellable?”</p>

<p>“Everything and nothing. It has just been an off
day with me all around. I have quarrelled with everybody
I could get at, and with myself more than all. I
need a balance-wheel worse than anything, Isabel, and
it’s for you to say whether I shall have it or not.”</p>

<p>He knelt to clear the smouldering fire in the grate,
and then got up to walk back and forth in front of it.
Isabel sat down and shaded her eyes from the light.
Levity was on the tip of her tongue, but she felt that
his mood was one in which ridicule would be as the
spark to gunpowder. Therefore she met it fairly and
tried to reason with him.</p>

<p>“Must we go all over the old ground again, Harry?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
she began. “Can’t I say something new and fresh—something
that will make it clear to you that the worst
possible thing that could happen to either of us would
be this that you have set your heart upon?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you can,” he objected, pausing in
front of the mantel to adjust a picture which was three
hairs’ breadths out of plumb. “But you may try, if
you care to.”</p>

<p>But having leave to try, Isabel found that new sayings
on a well-worn subject do not always suggest themselves
on the spur of the moment, and she was obliged to
leave the promise unfulfilled.</p>

<p>“It would only be dressing the old things up in new
clothes if I did,” she confessed, “and that wouldn’t
bring us to any better understanding.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a question of understanding, Isabel; it is
your ambition against my love—against reason, I had
pretty nearly said. I don’t believe you love anybody
else; and I—well, I’d be glad enough to take the
chances of winning later on what you say you can’t
give me now. That is the whole thing in a sentence,
and it is for you to say whether I shall go away from
here to-night the happiest of men or the most miserable.”</p>

<p>He said it calmly and with the air of one who has
weighed and measured the possibilities of success or
failure. Then it was that Isabel first began dimly to
understand that Harry Antrim, her schoolfellow and
playmate, had somehow come to man’s estate what time
she had been calling him a boy; and while she replied
out of an honest heart, the newborn conviction helped
her to choose the words.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be right, Harry, even if you are willing
to risk it and take the consequences, good or bad. I
want you to believe me when I say that I don’t seem to
know anything about the love that reaches out toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
marriage; and I am afraid I don’t want to. I love my
friends, and you more than any of the others; but I
would turn my back on all of them if the doing of it
would bring the answer to the question which is always
and always at the tip end of my paint brushes. It’s unwomanly,
hard-hearted—anything you like to call it—but
it is the simple truth. You don’t want to marry a
woman who feels that way, Harry, dear.”</p>

<p>He ignored the argument, if, indeed, he had tried to
follow it, and pressed her to give him his answer.</p>

<p>“Which is it to be, Isabel—Yes, or No?”</p>

<p>She parried the direct demand, not because there
was any present uncertainty in her own mind, but because
she discerned that in his eyes which warned her
to deal gently with him.</p>

<p>“I say you wouldn’t want to marry a woman without
a heart—a loving, home-making heart, I mean; and
that is what you would do if you took me. I have my
own little battle to fight, and I must fight it alone,
Harry. That is simple justice to you, or to any other
good man who might ask me to marry him.”</p>

<p>Antrim pounced upon the suggested alternative
with unreasoning and vindictive acerbity.</p>

<p>“Any other man, you say. Who is the other man,
Isabel?”</p>

<p>The steel of jealousy struck fire at once upon the
flint of Isabel’s quick temper, and her mood changed in
a twinkling.</p>

<p>“You intimated, the other day, that it might be Mr.
Brant,” she retorted with malice aforethought.</p>

<p>Antrim set his teeth hard to keep back the bitter
sayings that came uppermost, and when he could trust
himself to speak again tried hard to make her deny his
own assertion. “Just tell me there is no one else,
Isabel, and I’ll be satisfied,” he pleaded; but Isabel,
caring at that moment very little for Brant and a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
deal for Antrim, yet stubbornly refused to give her
lover even this small crumb of comfort.</p>

<p>“Then—once more, Isabel—give me my answer. Is
it to be Yes, or No?”</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t you see? Can’t you understand that it
must be No?”</p>

<p>“There is no reservation—no little green twig of
hope that you can hold out to me?”</p>

<p>“Not as I hope to be sincere, Harry.”</p>

<p>“Not if I should wait until you had won or lost the
battle?”</p>

<p>The little arrow of self-effacement found its mark,
and Isabel hesitated. With the enthusiasm of a young
devotee she had striven to unsex herself in the singleness
of her purpose, but Antrim’s pleading stirred the
woman within her, and in that fleeting instant of introspection
she saw how frail was the barrier defending her
ambition from his love. Honesty, pure and simple—the
shame of taking so much where she could give so
little—stepped in to save her.</p>

<p>“No, not even then, Harry. You deserve the full
cup, and I couldn’t be mean enough to offer you the
dregs. If I fail, I sha’n’t be worth anybody’s having;
and if I succeed—ah, God knows, but I am afraid I
should be still less the woman you ought to marry.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” he said, and held out his hand.
“Let us say ‘Good-bye’ and have it over with.”</p>

<p>She put her hand in his and let him keep it while
she said: “It mustn’t be ‘Good-bye,’ Harry. I can’t
afford to lose you as a friend—as a—as a brother.”</p>

<p>He smiled reproachfully. “And you said you would
try to say something new!” Then the little upflash of
pleasantry died out, and he spoke as one who leaves
hope behind. “No, Isabel; I meant it literally. It
must be ‘Good-bye,’ so far as I am concerned. I
couldn’t go on as we’ve been going on all these years; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
should go mad, some day when the right man turns up,
and do that which would make you hate me. No, I
shouldn’t”—the denial came quickly in response to the
distress that crept into her eyes—“no, I shouldn’t do
that, for your sake; but I should be sore and miserable,
and that would hurt you, too. You wouldn’t want that,
would you?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and he stood irresolute for a
moment. Then he said: “Won’t you kiss me, Isabel?
You haven’t, you know, since we used to play boy and
girl games in the old, old days.”</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand quickly. “You mustn’t ask
that. It would—it would——”</p>

<p>How was he to know that she was trying to tell
him that it would undo all that had gone before; that
it would break down the frail barrier she had been at
such pains to uprear? How was he to guess that he
stood at last before the open door of the woman’s heart
of her; that he had but to take her in his arms to possess
her?</p>

<p>Not by anything that she said or did, truly; and yet
at that moment her love for him sprang full-armed into
being, filling her with joy unspeakable, and promising
thenceforth to dominate ambition and all else. But her
lover knew it not, and he turned away to grope in thick
darkness for the door because the vertigo of failure was
blinding him. On the threshold he stopped, and when
sight returned looked back at her as she stood under
the light of the high easel lamp.</p>

<p>He made sure that the picture and its setting would
be a lasting memory, and the sight of it brought back a
swelling wave of recollection that went nigh to submerging him.
There was the piano, where he had so
often stood beside her, turning the leaves of her music
while she played for him. In the corner, where the
cross light from the windows could be shaded and controlled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
from her chair, stood her easel—the workbench
before which she had spent so many patient hours. On
the wall opposite, hanging just where she could see it
while she worked, was the little Vedder—his one valuable
gift; and beside the fire, which was now burning
brightly, stood the easy-chair which had come to be
called his, so often had he claimed it.</p>

<p>Some such background he had always imagined for
his own home—the home wherein he could escape from
the growing responsibilities of his work; the home
which Isabel was to make for him. But she had said it
could never be, and she was sending him away without
hope, and with nothing but the remembrance of her
pity to fill the place she had made for herself in his life.
She might have kissed him once, he thought, and the
thought set itself in words before he could check it.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have made much difference to you,
Isabel; a kiss is only a little thing. And yet I had an
idea that if you gave me one the remembrance of it
would tide me over some of the hard places. That
was all.”</p>

<p>Her eyes met his when he began to say it, but she
neither saw nor heard him when he went away. When
she looked up and found him gone she ran to the door
to call him back, but she was not quick enough. The
night had swallowed him, and when she made sure of
it she went back to the studio to bury her face in the
lounge pillows and to cry bitterly—for what, she knew
not, save that her world seemed suddenly to have fallen
out of its orbit.</p>

<p>Thus the maid. And the man? As Brant had left
the same house a few nights earlier with the devil beckoning
him, so went Antrim, stumbling over the curb at
the crossing and splashing through the pools made by
the overflowing irrigation ditches without once realizing
the discomfort. It was mirth for the gods, doubtless.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
His trouble was only a microscopic bit of side
play in the great human comedy. But it was tragic
enough to the young man, and many a spoiled life answers
to promptings no more insistent than those which
gather, buzzardlike, to pick the bones of a starved
passion.</p>

<p>In the ruck of it Antrim tramped wearily back to
the city, unmindful of all the familiarities until some
one spoke to him at the corner of Sixteenth and Larimer
Streets. It was Grotter, the division engineer, and he
linked arms with the chief clerk and caught step.</p>

<p>“Chilly night, isn’t it, Harry?” he said, shouldering
his companion diagonally across the street toward a
stained-glass transparency marking the entrance to a
saloon. “I should think you’d freeze in that light
overcoat. Let’s go in here and have a nip to go to bed
on—what do you say?”</p>

<p>Now, no anchoret of the Libyan Desert was ever less
a tippler than was Antrim. But the thought of his
great disappointment came and grappled with him, and
the devil, to whom some very worthy people are yet willing
to accord a personality, tempted him with a specious
promise of comfort. So he did no more than hang
upon the doorstep while Grotter overpersuaded him.</p>

<p>This was at midnight, and therein lay one of life’s
little ironies. At the very moment when Isabel, kneeling
at her bedside, was trying with innocent cheeks
aflame to frame the first halting petition for her acknowledged
lover, Antrim was entering the house of
temptation with the engineer. And presently he joined
Grotter in a cup of some insidious mixture in which
beaten eggs and liquid fire seemed to be the chief ingredients,
sipping it slowly while he listened to the
engineer’s stories of his perils by fire, flood, and unruly
grade labourers in the mountains.</p>

<p>That was the beginning. In the end the devil’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
promise was kept after a fashion, inasmuch as Antrim
stumbled up the steps of Mrs. Seeley’s boarding house
some two hours later in a frame of mind which, whatever
may have been its lacks or its havings, was at least
bullet-proof on the side of sorrow.</p>

<small>“THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> her own way—which was the quietest and least
obtrusive of ways—Dorothy was quite as intolerant of
mysteries as was her father, and after the evening when
Brant had gone forth to seek and to save that which
was lost, small mysteries seemed to lie in wait for her at
every turn.</p>

<p>They began the following day with Brant’s brief
visit and abrupt departure. She had heard his voice in
the hall, and, a little later, the rustle of skirts as some
one—her mother, she thought it was at the time—had
gone in to meet him. Of what took place in the drawing-room
she knew nothing, but a few minutes afterward,
when she was going down to join them, he had
stumbled out into the hall, snatched his coat and hat
from the rack, and left the house without once looking
behind him. So much Dorothy saw from the stair,
and she also saw that he was excited and preoccupied,
and that his face was the face of one upon whom
trouble sharp and serious has come suddenly.</p>

<p>When she heard the gate clang behind him she went
to the drawing-room and found it empty; whereupon
that which had been merely singular became unaccountable.
Was it possible that he had taken offense because
he had been kept waiting? Dorothy thought she knew
him better than that. He was a grown man, and not a
foolish boy with a brand new dignity to battle for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Failing to account for the unaccountable, Dorothy
waited. He would doubtless come again, and with his
coming the apparent mystery would vanish. But when
the days passed and he came no more, she grew curious
and asked guarded questions of her mother—and received
ambiguous answers, since Mrs. Langford, with
maternal self-sufficiency, had deemed it unnecessary to
take either of her daughters into her confidence in
Brant’s affair.</p>

<p>So Dorothy wondered, and laid innocent little snares
to entrap her father, who had also grown singularly
reticent. And when these traps sprung harmless, she
tried Antrim, with no better results. No, Brant was
still in town, and the chief clerk was not aware of any
impending change in his plans. Thus Henry Antrim,
vaguely; but Dorothy’s attempt fell upon an inauspicious
moment, since it was made on the evening of Antrim’s
off day, and her questions were put while he was
waiting for Isabel to make ready for the jaunt <i>à l’opéra</i>.</p>

<p>After this failure Dorothy tried Will, and it was a
measure of her concern that she should appeal to him.
She had no news of him; had nothing save that which
an affectionate sister usually gets in an attempt to
fathom the unplumbed depths of a younger brother’s
churlishness. Knowing Will’s weakness, she ventured
carefully, but she was quite unprepared for his sudden
outburst of petulant brutality.</p>

<p>“You wonder where Mr. Brant is, do you?” he
sneered, mimicking her. “Well, you’ve no business to
wonder; that’s all there is about that.”</p>

<p>“Why, Will——”</p>

<p>“You needn’t try to wheedle me. I don’t know
where he is, and, what’s more, I don’t care, as long as he
keeps away from here.”</p>

<p>“But, Will, you must have some reason——”</p>

<p>“Reason enough,” he interrupted rudely; “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
that’s all you’ll get out of me in a thousand years.”
And he lighted a cigarette and put distance between
himself and the chance of further questioning.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing of Harding or his story, Dorothy
set her brother’s anger down to the account of a natural
feeling of resentment toward a comparative stranger
who had interfered in Will’s private affair. None the
less, the incident added another shrouding to the mystery
involving the draughtsman, and Dorothy’s curiosity
and concern went one step farther on the road toward
anxiety.</p>

<p>It was about this time that she began to notice a
rather remarkable change in Isabel. From being the
most outspoken member of the family, the younger sister
had developed a degree of reticence which was second
only to Will’s churlishness, though Dorothy fancied
it was sorrowful rather than sullen. From day to
day she spent less time at her easel, and twice Dorothy
had come upon her when her eyes were red with weeping.
To inquiry, jesting or solicitous, she was stonily
impervious, and when the thing became unbearable
Dorothy went to her mother again, meaning to be at
the heart of things if persistence could find the way.
She chose her time cunningly, attacking after her
mother had gone to bed, so there would be no chance of
retreat.</p>

<p>“How should I know, dear?” was the mother’s
reply to her first question about Isabel. “I haven’t
noticed anything wrong with her.”</p>

<p>“But there <i>is</i> something wrong,” Dorothy insisted.
“She hasn’t been like herself for days. She mopes, and
she doesn’t paint; and twice I have caught her crying,
though she denied it spitefully.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langford’s answer to that was conventionally
sympathetic.</p>

<p>“It is another of the unthinkable pictures, I suppose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
I do wish the child wouldn’t torment herself so
over her work. It is all well enough as an accomplishment,
but she needn’t make a martyr of herself. Harry
is quite right about that.”</p>

<p>Having a very considerable reverence for art, Dorothy
was not so sure of this, but she left the point uncontested
and asked a question suggested by the mention
of Harry Antrim.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose she has quarrelled with Harry,
do you?”</p>

<p>“It is quite possible. It’s a way they have had
ever since they were children together.”</p>

<p>“Still, it might be serious this time.”</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” said the mother easily. “Isabel
thinks a great deal more of him than she has ever admitted,
even to herself, perhaps. And as for Harry, I
would as soon think of the world coming to an end as of
his giving her up.”</p>

<p>Dorothy was silenced, but not convinced.</p>

<p>“That was one thing I wanted to speak about, mamma,”
she said, gathering herself for the plunge; “but
there is another. I want to know what has come over
us all lately. We seem to be groping about in the dark,
trying to hide things from each other. What is the
mystery? and why can’t I share it?”</p>

<p>“Mystery? Nonsense, child! there is no mystery.”</p>

<p>But Dorothy was insistent. “Yes, there is. First,
Mr. Brant does us a kindness and drops us, all in the
same day. Then, when I wonder at it, you put me off,
and father goes deaf, and Will gets angry. And when
I ask Harry a civil question about his friend, he snaps
me up only a little less savagely than brother. Now
Isabel has turned blue and won’t talk, and—and, altogether
we seem to be turning into a family of freaks.
What is at the bottom of it all? Why doesn’t Mr. Brant
come here any more?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>The mother’s smile would have been full of meaning
for the daughter if the darkness had not hidden it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Brant probably has his own reasons for not
coming, and they are doubtless very good ones.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that? Do you know what
they are?” Dorothy demanded, being fully determined
not to be baffled.</p>

<p>It was a point-blank question, but Mrs. Langford
evaded it with considerable skill:</p>

<p>“I? What a question! Mr. Brant is not likely to
take me into his confidence.”</p>

<p>For the moment Dorothy had an uncomfortable
feeling that she had been making mountains out of
molehills, and in that moment she retreated. But when
she was alone the perplexities assumed their normal
proportions again; nay, they grew even larger when she
was reluctantly driven to the conclusion that the late
attack on the maternal stronghold had failed because
her mother was the better fencer.</p>

<p>After all, it was Isabel who gave her the clew to a
startling solution of the mysteries, and the manner of
its giving was this: The sisters occupied adjoining
rooms connected by a curtained archway, and when
Dorothy went from her mother’s room to her own she
found the curtains dropped—a thing without precedent,
and emphasizing very sharply the barrier that Isabel
sought to rear between herself and the other members of
the family.</p>

<p>Dorothy was hurt, but she was too truly a Langford
to take the risk of making unwelcome advances. So
she went to bed with eyelashes wet, and with a sore spot
in her heart in which the ache was quite out of proportion
to the wounding incident of the dropped curtains.
Just as she was falling asleep the curtains parted and
Isabel stole softly into the room, to go down upon her
knees at the bedside. Dorothy made no sign at first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
but when her sister buried her face in the bedclothes
and began to sob, compassion quickly found words—and
a little deed.</p>

<p>“What is it, Bella, dear?” she asked, with an arm
around her sister’s neck.</p>

<p>“Everything,” said Isabel to the counterpane.</p>

<p>“But what, dear? Can’t you trust me?”</p>

<p>Isabel shook her head to the first pleading and
nodded to the second. Dorothy understood, and pressed
the point gently.</p>

<p>“Is it a picture?—won’t the new one find itself?”</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s something a great deal worse than unthinkable
pictures,” said Isabel dismally.</p>

<p>“Then it must be very bad indeed. Tell me about
it, Bella, dear.”</p>

<p>“I can’t; there isn’t anything to tell. He is gone—I
sent him away, and he will never come back!” sobbed
Isabel, with womanly inconsistency.</p>

<p>Dorothy permitted herself a little sigh of relief. It
was only a lovers’ quarrel between her sister and Harry,
the last of many, and perhaps a little more serious than
some of the others, but still only that. The wound
would heal of itself, as such hurtings do, yet she made
haste to pour the wine and oil of sympathy into it.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, dear. He will come back—he can’t
help coming back,” she prophesied confidently.</p>

<p>Isabel shook her head as one who knows and may
not be comforted. “No, he won’t—not the man that
I sent away. Harry, the good-natured, obstinate boy
that we used to tease and make fun of, might; but this
grown man that I never knew till the other day is quite
different. He will never put it off with a laugh and
come back as if nothing had happened—I know he
won’t.”</p>

<p>Thus Isabel, thinking only of the seeming change
wrought in her lover by the quick shifting of her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
point of view, and Dorothy, with the chill of a nameless
fear benumbing her, could only repeat her prophecy:</p>

<p>“He will come back; never fear, Bella.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could believe it, but I can’t. O Dothy,
if you could have seen his face when he went away! I
shall never forget how he looked, not if I should live to
be a hundred.”</p>

<p>Dorothy had a fleeting vision of a man hurrying out
through the hall with a look of desperate trouble in his
eyes, and in a flash the apparent ambiguity in Isabel’s
confession vanished. It was her sister, and not her
mother, who had gone to meet Mr. Brant. It was he,
and not Harry, whom Isabel had sent away, and for
whose loss she was grieving.</p>

<p>Dorothy shut her eyes hard, and for a moment the
pain of it was sharp enough to make her shrink from the
innocent cause of it. Then a great wave of thankfulness
swept over her when she remembered that her
secret was yet her own. And close upon the heels of
gratitude came a growing wonder that she could have
been so blind. She might have known from the first
that it was Isabel. It was plain enough now. His gentle
deference to her sister’s moods, his helpful criticism
of her work, his evident determination to give Antrim
the preference which was his by right, leaving Isabel
free to choose between them. All these things pointed
to but one conclusion, and Dorothy was thankful again;
this time for the darkness which hid the hot blushes.
For she remembered how ready she had been to read
quite a different meaning into all of his sayings and
doings.</p>

<p>And the little sister of fickleness? Dorothy was
loyal after her kind, and she quickly found excuses for
Isabel. Was it not what always happens when a man
of the world and a stranger is pitted against a playmate
lover?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>So the pyramid of misapprehension was builded
course by course until it lacked only the capstone, and
this was added in the answer to Dorothy’s question:</p>

<p>“When did all this happen, Bella, dear?”</p>

<p>“The last time he was here; years ago, it seems to
me—but perhaps it is only months or weeks.”</p>

<p>This was the capstone, and there was now no room
for doubt. It was nearly two weeks since Brant had
stopped coming, and there had been no intermission in
Harry’s visits. Indeed, it was only a few days since he
had taken Isabel to the opera. Dorothy choked down a
little sigh, put herself and her own dream of happiness
aside, and became from that moment her sister’s loyal
and loving ally.</p>

<p>“Don’t be discouraged, dear,” she said caressingly.
“You must learn to wait and be patient. I know him—better,
perhaps, than you do—and I say he will come
back. He will never take ‘No’ for an answer while
you and he live.”</p>

<p>Isabel got up and felt under her sister’s pillow for
a handkerchief.</p>

<p>“You are good and comforting, Dothy,” she whispered,
“and I think I am happy in spite of my misery.”
She bent to leave a kiss on the cheek of goodness and
comfort. “I am going to bed now; good night. Why,
how hot your face is!”</p>

<p>“How cold your lips are, you mean,” said Dorothy
playfully. “Go to bed, dear, and don’t worry any more.
You will make yourself sick.”</p>

<p>But when her sister was gone she lay very still, with
closed eyes and trembling lips, and so fought her small
battle to the bitter end, winning finally the victory
called self-abnegation, together with its spoils, the mask
of cheerfulness and the goodly robe of serenity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>THE ANCHOR COMES HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Brant</span> awoke on the morning following his excommunication
with one idea dominant, and that pointed
to flight. Whatever he might be able to do with his life
elsewhere, it was evident that the Denver experiment
was a pitiful failure. This he said, cursing the fatuous
assurance which had kept him from flying to the antipodes
at the outset. The city of the plain was merely
a clearing house for the mining camps, and sooner or
later his story would have found him out, lacking help
from Harding or any other personal enemy.</p>

<p>“Anybody but a crazy fool would have known that
without having to wait for an object lesson; but, of
course, I had to have it hammered into me with blows,”
was the way he put it to himself on the walk downtown.
“Well, I have had the lesson, and I’ll profit by
it and move on—like little Joey. If they would give
me the chance I’d rather be a sheep dog than a wolf; but
it seems that the world at large hasn’t much use for the
wolf who turns collie—damn the world at large! If I
hadn’t given my word to Hobart I’d be tempted to go
back and join the fighting minority. As it is, I’ll run
for it.”</p>

<p>So he said, and so he meant to do; but a small thing
prevented. Colonel Bowran was away, and he could
not well desert in his chief’s absence. But this need no
more than delay the flight. The chief engineer’s absences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
were usually short, and a day or two more or less
would neither make nor mar the future.</p>

<p>So ran the prefigurings, but the event was altogether
different from the forecasting, as prefigured events are
prone to be. For three days Brant made shift to sink
his trouble in a sea of hard work, but on the fourth he
had a note from the front, saying that the chief engineer’s
absence would be extended yet other days. At
the same time, lacking the data contained in the field
notes carried off by the colonel, he ran out of work.
After that the days were empty miseries. In the first
idle hour he began to brood over the peculiar hardness
of his lot, as a better man might, and with the entrance
of the remorseless devil of regret such poor forgetfulness
as he had been able to wring out of hard work
spread its wings and fled away.</p>

<p>At the end of twenty-four hours he was fairly desperate,
and on the second day of enforced idleness he
wrote a long letter to Hobart:</p>

<p>“The devil has another job for me,” he began, “and
if it wasn’t for my promise to you I should take it.
Things have turned out precisely as I knew they would,
and you are to blame; first, for dragging me out of the
pit when I wasn’t worth saving, and next, for telling me
that I might come to Denver when I should have gone
to the ends of the earth. By which you will understand
that my sins have found me out. I don’t know
that you care to hear the story, but I do know that I
shall presently go mad if I don’t tell it to somebody.
If it bores you, just remember what I say—that you are
to blame.</p>

<p>“Before I begin I may as well tell you that it is
about a woman, so you can swear yourself peaceful before
you come at the details. I met her on the train
the day I came down from the Colorow district—the
day of my return to civilization. Nothing came of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
first meeting, save that I got a glimpse of the gulf that
separates a good woman from a bad man; but later,
after I had begun to look ahead a little to the things
that might be, we met again—this time in her own
home, and I with an introductory godfather.</p>

<p>“That was two months ago. Up to last Wednesday
everything went as merry as a marriage bell. The father
liked me, the mother tolerated me, and the young
woman—but let that pass. I was welcome enough, and
sufficient unto the day was the good thereof. As a matter
of course, I was living in a fool’s paradise, walking
daily over a mine that any chance spark might explode.
I knew all that, and yet I was happy till last Wednesday.
That was when the mine was fired.</p>

<p>“It came about in the most natural way, but the
story is too long to write out, and I don’t mean to weary
you needlessly. It is enough to say that the mother
found me out. You can guess what happened. I went
to the house, knowing nothing of what was in store for
me. There was a little scene in which I played the
heavy villain to the mother’s part of outraged virtue—and
the end of it is that I am once more a pariah.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see the young woman; that wasn’t permitted,
of course. But I suppose she knows all about
it, and the thought makes me want to run amuck. In
the whole dreary business there is only this single grain
of comfort: I know who gave me away. And when I
meet that man, God do so to me and more if I don’t
send him where he belongs, and that without benefit of
clergy. And you won’t say me nay when I tell you
that his name is Harding.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will want to know what I am going
to do next. I don’t know, and that is God’s truth. The
day after the thing happened I meant to vanish; but the
chief was away and I couldn’t very well shut up the office
and walk out. Since then the mill has been grinding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
until I don’t know what I want to do. Sometimes
I am tempted to throw the whole thing overboard and
go back to the hog wallow. It is about all I am fit for;
and nobody cares—unless you do.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake write me a letter and brace me up
if you can; I never needed it worse. The chief is still
away; I can’t do another stroke of work till he comes
back with the field books, and there isn’t a soul here
that I can talk to. Consequently I’m going mad by
inches. I suppose you have taken it for granted that
I love the young woman, though I believe I haven’t said
so in so many words. I do, and that is what racks me.
If I go away, I give her up for good and all. If I stay I
can’t get her. If I go to the devil again—but we
won’t discuss that phase of it now. Write, and hold
me to my word, if you love me.”</p>

<p>This letter was mailed on the train Wednesday evening,
and in the ordinary course of events it should have
brought an answer by the Saturday. This Brant knew,
and he set himself to wear out the interval with what
constancy there was in him, doing nothing more irrational
than the devoting of two of the evenings to aimless
trampings in the Highlands, presumably in the unacknowledged
hope that he might chance to see Dorothy
at a distance. He did not see her, did not venture near
enough to Altamont Terrace to stand any chance of seeing her,
and when the Saturday passed without bringing
a letter from Hobart, hope deferred gave birth to heaviness.</p>

<p>“He is disgusted, I suppose, and I can’t blame him,”
was his summing up of it when the postman had made
his final round. “God in heaven, I wish the colonel
would come back and give me my quittance! If I have
to sit here and grill through many more days I shall be
ripe for any devil’s sickle of them all!”</p>

<p>By which it will appear that despairing impulse was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
already straining at the bit. None the less, when six
o’clock came he went home, ate his supper, read till
midnight, and then went to bed, though not to sleep.
On the morrow, which was the Sunday, he set on foot a
little emprise the planning of which had eased him
through the wakeful hours of the night. It was this:
Dorothy had a class in a mission school, and this he
knew, and the place, but not the hour. For the latter
ignorance he was thankful, since it gave him an excuse
for haunting the neighbourhood of the mission chapel
during the better part of the day. Late in the afternoon
he was rewarded by catching a glimpse of her as
she went in, and, heartened by this, he did sentry duty
on the opposite side of the street until the school was
dismissed.</p>

<p>She came out among the last with a group of children
around her, and Brant’s heart went warm at the
sight. “God bless her!” he said under his breath;
and then he crossed the street to put his fate to the
touch. If she knew—if her mother had told her—her
greeting would show it forth, and he would know then
that the worst had befallen.</p>

<p>They met at the corner, and Dorothy looked up as
she was bidding her children good-bye. He made sure
she saw him, though there was no sign of recognition
in her eyes. Then she bent over one of the little
ones as if to avoid him, and he went on quickly with
rage and shame in his heart, and the devil’s sickle gathering
in the harvest which had been ripening through
the days of bitterness.</p>

<p>That night he went to his room as usual after supper,
but not to stay. At eight o’clock he flung down the
book he had been trying to read, slipped the weapon
which had once been James Harding’s into the pocket
of his overcoat, and left the house. Half an hour later
he was standing at the bar in the Draconian kennel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Tom Deverney was welcoming him with gruff heartiness.</p>

<p>“Well, say! I thought you’d got lost in the shuffle,
sure. Where have you been—over the range again?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t been out of town.”</p>

<p>“You took blame’ good care not to show up here,
then,” retorted Deverney. “First you know you’ll
have to be packing a card case; that’s about what you’ll
have to do.”</p>

<p>“I have been busy,” said Brant. Then the smell
of the liquor got into his nostrils and he cut himself
adrift with a word. “Shall we have a drink together,
and call it square, Tom?”</p>

<p>Deverney spun a glass across the polished mahogany
and reached for a conical bottle in the cooler. “I
don’t know as I ought to drink with you—you wouldn’t
drink with me the last time you showed up. What shall
it be—a little of the same?”</p>

<p>“Always,” said Brant. “I don’t mix.” He helped
himself sparingly and touched glasses with the bartender.</p>

<p>“Here’s how.”</p>

<p>“Looking at you.”</p>

<p>Brant paid, and the bartender dipped the glasses.
“Going to try your luck a while this evening?” he
asked.</p>

<p>The backslider glanced at the tables and shook his
head. “No, I guess not. I’m a little off to-night, and
I’d be pretty sure to go in the hole.”</p>

<p>Deverney laughed. “That’s what they all say when
they are broke. I’ll stake you.”</p>

<p>“No—thanks; I didn’t mean that. I have money
enough.”</p>

<p>He strolled down the long room toward the faro
table, turning the matter over in his mind. He had left
Mrs. Seeley’s with madness in his heart, and with a fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
determination to go and do something desperate—something
that would make Dorothy’s heart ache if she could
know of it. But now that he was on the brink of the
pool of ill-doing the stench of it sickened him. Calling
the plunge revenge, it seemed very mean and despicable.</p>

<p>Halfway down the room he faced about, and but for
the drink he had taken would have gone home. But
the liquor tipped the scale. It was adulterated poison,
as it was bound to be in such a place, and Brant—at his
worst the most temperate of men on the side of appetite—had
neither touched nor tasted since turning the new
leaf. So the decent prompting passed, and he wheeled
and went back to watch the game.</p>

<p>After that the descent was easy. A dollar ventured
became two, the two four, and the four eight; Presently
one of the sitters rose, and Brant dropped into the
vacant chair, lighted a fresh cigar, and ordered another
drink. It was what he used to do in the old days when
his conscience stirred uneasily, and now, as then, the intoxicant
had the desired effect. It slew the man in him
without unstringing the steady nerve of the gamester.</p>

<p>Since he cared not whether he lost or won, luck was
with him from the first and throughout. Play as he
might, he could not lose; and when he rose at midnight,
Draco, who acted as his own banker, had to stop the
game and go to his safe for more money before he could
declare the dividend.</p>

<p>“There are your ducats,” he said, tossing a thick
roll of bills across the table. “It’s an open game, and I
haven’t anything to say; all the same, I’m willing to see
you pull out. This outfit isn’t any blooming gold
mine.”</p>

<p>Brant unrolled the money, twisted it into a spill,
and handed it back.</p>

<p>“Keep it, if you like; I haven’t any use for it.”
Draco laughed. “Yes, I will!—and have you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
charging back here with a gun when you’re sob—when
you’ve had time to think about it? Not much! I
haven’t got any time to open up a shooting gallery and
play bow-and-arrow with you, George.”</p>

<p>Brant stuffed the money into his pocket and went
his way. As he was going out, Deverney beckoned him.</p>

<p>“Say, I heard two fellows talking about the way
you were winning,” he said, leaning across the bar and
lowering his voice. “I didn’t know either one of them,
but they’re a hard-looking lot—the kind that waits for
you at the mouth of a dark alley. Are you fixed?”</p>

<p>Brant nodded. “You say you don’t know them?”</p>

<p>“Only by sight. They’ve both been here before;
though not together till to-night.”</p>

<p>“Talk as if they knew me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They do know you by name. One of them
said something about ‘spotting’ you to-night.”</p>

<p>Now, when one has scattered the seed of enmity impartially
in all soils a goodly crop of ill-wishers may be
looked for in any harvest field however well inclosed.
Since he had never turned aside to avoid a quarrel in
any one of the ill-starred years, Brant had enemies
a-plenty; but holding his own life lightly he had never
let the fact trouble him. None the less, he was curious
enough to ask Deverney if he could describe the
two men. The bartender could and did.</p>

<p>“One of them is tall and rather thin, about the size
and shape of the Professor, only he has a beard like a
billy goat, and a shock of red hair that looks as if it
hadn’t been cut for a month of Sundays. The other is—well,
I should say he looks like a chunky man gone
thin, if you can savez that; smooth face, with a sort of
bilious look, and the wickedest eye you ever saw in a
man’s head.”</p>

<p>Brant shook his head slowly. “I don’t recall either
of them,” he said. Then the Berserker in him came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
to the surface, and he took the pistol from his pocket
and twirled the chambers to see that they were all filled.
“If they know me, they know what to expect, and I’ll
try and see that they are not disappointed. Much
obliged for the hint. Good night, Tom.”</p>

<p>He went out with his head up and his hands in his
pockets, bearing himself as if he would as soon end the
bad day with a battle to the death as otherwise. At the
corner above he saw the two men standing in a doorway
on the opposite side of the street, recognised them at
once from Deverney’s description, and, giving place to
a sudden impulse of recklessness, went straight across to
them. They paid no attention to him, not even when
he stopped and looked them over with a cool glance of
appraisal that was little less than a challenge. But
when he went on they followed leisurely and at a safe
distance. Brant knew they were dogging him, but he
neither loitered nor hastened. If they chose to overtake
and waylay him he would know what to do. If
they did not, the morning newspapers would lack a stirring
item, and two footpads would have a longer lease
of life.</p>

<p>In the challenging glance he had passed the taller
man by as a stranger, but the face of the other haunted
him. There was something exasperatingly familiar
about it, and yet no single feature by which it could
be identified. Analyzed in detail, the puzzle arranged
itself above and below a line drawn across the upper
lip of the half-familiar face. The broad flat nose,
high cheek bones, and sunken eyes were like those
of some one he had seen before. But the hard mouth
with the lines of cruelty at the corners, and the projecting
lower jaw, seemed not to belong to the other features.</p>

<p>“It’s a freak, and nothing more or less,” he told
himself, when he had reasoned out so much of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
puzzle. “The fellow has the top of somebody else’s
head—somebody I have known. I wonder how he got
it?”</p>

<p>There was an easy answer to the query, and if Brant
had guessed it he would have been careful to choose the
well-lighted streets on the way up town. If he had
chanced to remember that a thick curling beard, unkempt
and grizzled, would mask the cruel mouth and
ugly jaw, he would have recognised the face though it
chanced that he had seen it but once, and then in a moment
of fierce excitement. And if he had reflected
further that a beard may be donned as well as
doffed, and that the wig-maker’s art still flourishes, he
would have realized that out of a very considerable
collection of enemies made in the day of wrath none
were more vindictive or desperate than the two who
kept him in sight as he made his way back to Mrs.
Seeley’s.</p>

<p>They closed upon him, or made as if they would,
when he reached the gate, and he fingered his pistol and
waited. The few hours which overlaid his late meeting
with Dorothy had gone far toward undoing the good
work of the preceding months of right living. While
he waited, the man-quelling fiend came and sat in the
seat of reason, and it was Plucky George of the mining
camps rather than Colonel Bowran’s draughtsman who
stood at Mrs. Seeley’s gate and fingered the lock of the
ready weapon.</p>

<p>As if they had some premonition of what was lying
in wait for them, the two men veered suddenly and
crossed the street. Had Brant known who they were
and why they had followed him, it is conceivable that
their shadows would never have darkened the opposite
sidewalk. As it was, he opened the gate and went in
with a sneer at their lack of courage in the last resort.</p>

<p>“Two to one, and follow a man a mile at midnight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
without coming to the scratch,” he scoffed. “I have a
good mind to go over and call their bluff alone. It
would serve them right to turn the tables on them, and
I’d do it if I thought they had anything worth the
trouble of holding them up.”</p>

<small>WHEN HATE AND FEAR STRIKE HANDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he was suffered to escape after his attempt
upon Brant’s life in the private room at Elitch’s, James
Harding tarried in Denver only so long as the leaving
time of the first westward bound train constrained
him. Nevertheless, he went as one driven, and with
black rage in his heart, adding yet another tally to the
score of his account against the man who had banished
him.</p>

<p>But, like Noah’s dove, he was destined to find no rest
for the sole of his foot. Having very painstakingly
worn out his welcome in the larger mining camps, he
was minded to go to Silverette, hoping to pick a living
out of the frequenters of Gaynard’s. Unluckily, he
was known also in Silverette; and unluckily again,
word of his coming preceded him from Carbonado, the
railway station nearest to the isolated camp at the foot
of Jack Mountain. Harding walked up from Carbonado,
was met at a sharp turn in the wagon road by a
committee from the camp above, and was persuaded by
arguments in which levelled rifles played a silent but
convincing part to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>Returning to Carbonado, his shrift was but a hand’s
breadth longer. On the second day, when he was but
barely beginning to draw breath of respite, he was recognised
as the slayer of one William Johnson, was
seized, dragged into the street, and after an exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
trying half hour was escorted out of camp and across
the range by a guard of honour with drawn weapons.</p>

<p>Under such discouragements he promptly determined
to face the ills he knew, drank deeply at the well
of desperation, and, making a forced march to the nearest
railway station, boarded the first train for Denver.
It was a hazardous thing to do. Brant was a man of his
word, and the banished one had known him to go to extremities
upon slighter provocation. But, on the other
hand, Denver was a considerable city, and their ways
might easily lie apart in it. Moreover, if the worst
should come, it was but man to man, with plenty of old
scores to speed the bullet of self-defence.</p>

<p>So reasoning, Harding stepped from the train at the
Denver Union Station in the gray dawn of an October
morning, Argus-eyed, and with his hand deep buried in
the pocket of his ulster. The time was auspicious, and
he reached a near-by lodging house without mishap.
Through one long day he remained in hiding, but after
dark, when the prowling instinct got the better of prudence,
he ventured out. In a kennel some degrees
lower in the scale descending than Draco’s he met a
man of his own kidney whom he had once known in the
camps, and who was but now fresh from the Aspen district
and from an outpost therein known as Taggett’s
Gulch.</p>

<p>This man drank with Harding, and when his tongue
was a little loosened by the liquor grew reminiscent.
Did the Professor recall the killing of a man in the
Gulch a year or so back—a man named Benton, or
Brinton? Harding had good cause to remember it,
and he went gray with fear and listened with a thuggish
demon of suffocation waylaying his breath. Assuredly,
everybody remembered. What of it? Nothing much,
save that the brother of the murdered man was in Colorado
with the avowed intention of finding and hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
the murderer, if money and an inflexible purpose might
contribute to that end.</p>

<p>That was the gist of the matter, and when Harding
had pumped his informant dry, he shook the man off
and went out to tramp the streets until he had fairly
taken the measure of the revived danger. Summed up,
it came to this: sooner or later the avenger of blood
would hear of Brant, and after that the end would come
swiftly and the carpenters might safely begin to build
the gallows for the slayer of Henry Brinton. Harding
had a vivid and disquieting picture of the swift sequence
of events. The brother would find Brant, and
the latter would speedily clear up the mystery and
give the avenger the proofs. Then the detective
machinery would be set in motion, and thereafter the
murderer would find no lurking place secret enough to
hide him.</p>

<p>Clearly something must be done, and that quickly.
Concealment was the first necessity; James Harding
must disappear at once and effectually. That preliminary
safely got over, two sharp corners remained to be
turned at whatever cost. The incriminating evidence
now in Brant’s hands must be secured and destroyed,
and Brant himself must be silenced before the avenger
of blood should find and question him.</p>

<p>The disguise was a simple matter. At one time in
his somewhat checkered career Harding had been a
supernumerary in a Leadville variety theatre. Hence,
the smooth-shaven, well-dressed man who paid his bill
at the Blake Street lodging house at ten o’clock that
night bore small likeness to the bearded and rather
rustic-looking person who engaged a room a few minutes
later at a German <i>Gasthaus</i> in West Denver. The
metamorphosis wrought out in artistic detail, Harding
put it at once to the severest test. Going out again, he
sought and found the man from Taggett’s Gulch, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
was unrecognised. Introducing himself as a farmer
from Iowa, he persuaded the man to pilot him through
the mazes of the Denver underworld, and when he had
met and talked with a dozen others who knew the Professor
rather better than he knew himself, he went back
to the West Side <i>Gasthaus</i> with a comforting abatement
of the symptoms of strangulation.</p>

<p>Having thus purchased temporary safety, the castaway
began presently to look about him for the means
to the more important end. Night after night he
haunted the purlieus, hoping that a lucky chance might
reveal Brant’s whereabouts. But inasmuch as Brant
was yet walking straitly, nothing came of this, and in
his new character Harding could not consistently ask
questions. Twice he met William Langford face to
face, and, knowing that the boy could probably give
him Brant’s street and number, he was about to risk an
interview with his <i>protégé</i> in his proper person when the
god of evil-doers gave him a tool exactly fitted to his
hand.</p>

<p>It was on the Sunday evening of Brant’s relapse.
Harding had been making his usual round, and at Draco’s
he met a man whose face he recognised despite its
gauntness and the change wrought by the razor. A
drink or two broke the ice of unfamiliarity, and then
Harding led the way to a card room in the rear on the
pretext of seeking a quiet place where they might drink
more to their better acquaintance. In the place of
withdrawal Harding kept up the fiction of bucolic simplicity
only while the waiter was bringing a bottle and
glasses. Then he said: “I reckon you’d be willing to
swear you had never seen me before, wouldn’t you,
Gasset?”</p>

<p>The big man gone thin was in the act of pouring
himself another drink, but he put the bottle down and
gave evidence of a guilty conscience by starting from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
his chair, ready for flight or fight as the occasion might
require.</p>

<p>“Who the blazes are you, anyway?” he demanded,
measuring the distance to the door in a swift glance
aside.</p>

<p>Harding pulled off the wig and beard and leered
across at him. “Does that help you out any?”</p>

<p>Gasset sprang to his feet with a terror-oath choking
him and retreated backward to the door, hand on
weapon.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it, Jim!” he gasped. “Don’t, I
say. I never meant to hurt her—any of ’em will swear
to that!”</p>

<p>Harding struck a match and relighted his cigar.
He did it with leisurely thoroughness, turning the
match this way and that and ignoring his quarry much
as a cat ignores a mouse which can by no means escape.
Gasset stood as one fascinated, watching every
movement of the slim fingers and feeling blindly behind
him for the knob of the door. Whereat Harding
laughed mockingly and pointed to the bottle on the
table.</p>

<p>“You had better come back here and take a little
more of the same to stiffen your nerve, Ike. You
couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn just now.”</p>

<p>Gasset found the doorknob finally and breathed
freer when it yielded under his hand. “Give me a
show for my life, Jim!” he begged, widening the opening
behind him by stealthy half inches. “It ain’t
worth much, but, by God, I want it for a little while
yet!”</p>

<p>Harding laughed again. “What is the matter with
you? You would have been a dead man long ago if I
had wanted to drop you. Come back here and finish
your drink.”</p>

<p>Having more than once set his life over against his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
thirst, Gasset did it once again, filling his glass with
hands that shook, and swallowing the drunkard’s portion
at a gulp. The liquor steadied him a little and he
sat down.</p>

<p>“Then you ain’t out gunning for me?” he ventured.</p>

<p>“No; what made you think I was?”</p>

<p>Gasset scratched his head and tilted the bottle again.
“I don’t know, if you don’t. But it appears like to me,
if anybody had killed a sister of mine I’d want to get
square. And I reckon I wouldn’t split any hairs about
his being drunk or sober at the time, nor yet about
whether he went for to do it meaningly or just did it by
happen-so.”</p>

<p>Harding ignored the implied reproach and went on
to the more important matter:</p>

<p>“Damn that! It is enough for me to know that you
were trying to kill George Brant,” he said coolly. “Do
you still feel that way?”</p>

<p>Gasset rose unsteadily and the dull eyes of him
glowed in their sockets. “Look at me now, Jim, and
then recollect, if you can, what-all I used to be. You
know what that was; not any man in the camp could
put me on my back unless I was drunk. And now look
at me—a poor, miser’ble, broke-up wrack, just out o’
the horspital! <i>He</i> done it—filled me plum full of lead
when I was too crazy drunk to see single; that’s what he
done!”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose you wouldn’t be sorry if you had
the chance to even up with him,” said Harding, hastily
building up a plan which would enable him to make use
of this opportune ally.</p>

<p>“Now you are talking! Say, Jim, I’m hanging
on to what little scrap of life he has left me for just
nothing else. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Good; that is business,” quoth Harding. “I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
with you to stay. Find him for me, and I’ll help you
square the deal.”</p>

<p>“Find him?” echoed Gasset. “Why, man alive,
he is right out yonder at the faro table! You rubbed
up against him coming in here!”</p>

<p>“The devil you say!” Harding hastily resumed
the wig and the false beard, with a word explanatory.
“He mustn’t recognise me, or the game will be up before
it begins. Pull up your chair and we’ll talk this
thing over.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the two conspirators left the card
room and made their way singly through the crowd in
the game room to meet at the bar. Gasset had lingered
a moment at Brant’s elbow, and, having seen the winnings,
incautiously spoke of them to Harding in Tom
Deverney’s hearing. Harding shook his head, and
dragged his companion out to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“You will have to look out for Deverney—the barkeeper,”
he said. “He is Brant’s friend. The first
thing is to find out where he sleeps. We’ll go over to
the other corner and wait for him till he comes out.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE GOODLY COMPANY OF MISERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> gone so far astray on the Sunday, it was inevitable
that Brant should awake repentant and remorseful
on the Monday. He slept late, and when he
had breakfasted like a monk and had gone downtown
to face another day of enforced idleness in his office,
conscience rose up and began to ply its many-thonged
whip.</p>

<p>What a thrice-accursed fool he had made of himself,
and how completely he had justified Mrs. Langford’s
opinion of him! How infinitely unworthy the love of
any good woman he was, and how painstakingly he had
put his future beyond the hope of redemption! If
Colonel Bowran would only come back and leave him
free to go and bury himself in some unheard-of corner
of the world! This was the burden of each fresh outburst
of self-recrimination.</p>

<p>So much by way of remorse, but when he thought of
Dorothy, something like a measure of dubious gratitude
was mingled therewith—a certain thankfulness that the
trial of his good resolutions had come before he had
been given the possible chance of free speech with her—a
chance which might have involved her happiness as
well as his own peace of mind.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he groaned, flinging himself into a
chair and tossing his half-burned cigar out of the window.
“I ought to be glad that I found myself out before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
I had time to pull her into it. If they had let me
go on, and she would have listened to me, I should
have married her out of hand—married an angel, and I
with a whole nest of devils asleep in me waiting only for
a chance to come alive! God help me! I’m worse than
I thought I was—infinitely worse.—Come in!” This
last to some one at the door.</p>

<p>It was only the postman, and Brant took the letters
eagerly, hoping to find one from Hobart. He was disappointed,
but there was another note from the end-of-track
on the Condorra Extension, setting forth that
the chief engineer’s home-coming would be delayed yet
other days.</p>

<p>Brant read the colonel’s scrawl, and what was left
of his endurance took flight in an explosion of bad language.
A minute later he burst into Antrim’s office.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Craig?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“He has gone to Ogden,” said Antrim, wondering
what had happened to disturb the serenity of the self-contained
draughtsman.</p>

<p>“The devil he has! When will he be back?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—the last of the week, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Damn!”</p>

<p>Antrim laughed. “What ails you this morning?
You look as if you’d had a bad night. Come inside and
sit down—if you’re not too busy.”</p>

<p>Brant let himself in at the wicket in the counter-railing
and drew up a chair.</p>

<p>“I am not busy enough—that is one of the miseries.
And I want you to help me out, Harry. You have full
swing here when the old man is away, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why—yes, after a fashion. What has broke
loose?”</p>

<p>Brant looked askance at the stenographer, and the
chief clerk rightly interpreted the glance.</p>

<p>“O John,” he said, “I wish you would take these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
letters down and put them on No. 3. Hand them
to the baggageman yourself, and then you’ll be sure
they have gone.” And when the door closed behind
the young man he turned back to Brant. “Was that
what you wanted?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t know as it was necessary. There
is nothing particularly private about what I want to say.
You see, it is this way: Colonel Bowran is out on the
Extension, and Grotter is with him. I am alone here in
the office, and I’ve got to leave town suddenly. What I
want you to do is to put somebody in there to keep
house till the colonel returns.”</p>

<p>The chief clerk smiled. “It must be something
pretty serious to rattle you that way,” was his comment.
“You are a good enough railroad man to know that my
department has nothing to do with yours, except to ask
questions of it. And that reminds me: here is a letter
from the general manager asking if we have a late map
of the Denver yards. The president is coming west in
a day or two, and there is a plan on foot for extensions,
I believe.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Brant.</p>

<p>“It isn’t well—it’s ill. We haven’t any such map,
and I don’t see but what you will have to stay and make
one.”</p>

<p>Now, to a man in Brant’s peculiar frame of mind
employment was only one degree less welcome than immediate
release. Wherefore he caught at the suggestion
so readily that Antrim was puzzled.</p>

<p>“I thought you had to go away, whether or no,” he
said curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose I can put it off if I have to,” Brant
rejoined, trying to hedge.</p>

<p>“Which is another way of telling me to mind
my own business,” retorted Antrim good-naturedly.
“That’s all right; only, if you have struck a bone, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
can comfort yourself with the idea that you have plenty
of good company. No one of us has a monopoly of all
the trouble in the world.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not.” Brant said so much, and
then got far enough away from his own trouble to notice
that the chief clerk was looking haggard and seedy.</p>

<p>“You look as if you had been taking a turn at the
windlass yourself, Harry. Have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, something of that sort,” replied Antrim, but
he turned quickly to the papers on his desk.</p>

<p>“Nothing that I can help you figure out, is it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the chief clerk, so savagely that Brant
smiled.</p>

<p>“Which the same is none of <i>my</i> business, and so
we are quits,” he rejoined.</p>

<p>Antrim was much too good-hearted to let the matter
rest there, and he made halting amends.</p>

<p>“I would give you a chance, Brant, quicker than I
would anybody else I know; but it is no use. Every
fellow has to take his own medicine.”</p>

<p>Brant nodded, and after a little Antrim went on as
one who changes the subject.</p>

<p>“Been over to the Highlands lately?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I thought you hadn’t. Dorothy was asking about
you the last time I saw her.”</p>

<p>“When was that?” The question was so eager that
Antrim, remembering his unjust suspicion of Isabel,
had a pang of honest shame.</p>

<p>“Last Wednesday. She wanted to know if you had
left town.”</p>

<p>Brant was plunged at once into a problem in which
there were many more unknown quantities than integral
facts. When he came to the surface it was to catch
at a straw. Perhaps, after all, Dorothy was yet in happy
ignorance of all the distressing things her mother could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
tell her; in which case she had merely failed to see him
when he had lifted his hat to her the day before. And,
if that were true, his late excursion into the realm of
things evil was nothing better than the sequence of a
hideous mistake. The logic of the thing appalled him,
and he made haste to go back to first principles, planting
himself desperately upon the assertion that she must
have seen him. Having done that, he was immediately
swept adrift again by an overwhelming desire to know
the truth of the matter beyond peradventure of doubt.
A suggestion offered, and he pounced upon it. He
would make an unconscious messenger of Antrim.</p>

<p>“When are you going over there again, Harry?” he
asked, making the question as incurious as might be.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the chief clerk, burying his
face in his desk.</p>

<p>“Well, when you do, if Miss Langford asks you any
more questions about me, you may say that I haven’t
been away, but that I am going before long.”</p>

<p>Antrim looked up with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>“I don’t begin to know what you are driving at.
Why don’t you go and tell her yourself; you know the
way.”</p>

<p>It was Brant’s turn to prevaricate, and he did it so
clumsily that Antrim stopped him in sheer pity.</p>

<p>“That will do,” he interrupted. “You are only
getting tangled up in a lot of polite lies, and that
doesn’t help matters. Besides, if it is a question of
carrying messages to Hollywood, I can’t help you; I am
out of the running myself—no, don’t ask any questions,
please. I can’t talk about the thing, even to so good a
friend as you are.”</p>

<p>At this conjuncture the stenographer came back,
and Brant took up the general manager’s letter. “I’ll
take this and make the map,” he said. “Does he want
a tracing, or a blue print?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“A tracing, I guess; they will want to make marks
on it,” replied Antrim.</p>

<p>And Brant went back to his office and fell upon the
task with such singleness of purpose that the day was
gone before he realized it.</p>

<p>As he was leaving the office at six o’clock, a messenger
boy met him at the door with a note. It was
from the editor of the Plainsman, and it was both brief
and noncommittal.</p>

<p>“If you have nothing better to do, come down to
the office this evening,” it ran. “I have a promising
little mystery in hand in which you may be interested.”</p>

<p>Brant went back to his desk and wrote a reply. He
had meant to go on with his work during the evening,
but the editor’s invitation came as a happy alternative.
The making of a single map would not afford surcease
from the devil of idleness for very long, and anything
which promised to postpone the evil day of emptiness
was to be accounted a blessing. Wherefore he accepted
gladly, and, when the answer was written and despatched,
went to supper with the comforting thought
that the next few hours were safely provided for.</p>

<small>“AS APPLES OF GOLD IN PICTURES OF SILVER”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was yet early in the evening when Brant climbed
the stairs of the Plainsman building to keep his appointment
with Forsyth. The presses were roaring in
the basement, but on the top floor the reporters’ rooms
were untenanted, and the telegraph editor, writing furiously
under the sheen of the droplight in his noisy den,
was the only member of the staff on duty. When
Brant’s form darkened his doorway, the man of specials
snapped his key and looked up.</p>

<p>“Forsyth’s gone down to supper,” he said. “Told
me to tell you to make yourself at home till he came
back.”</p>

<p>Brant nodded, and went on through the deserted
offices to the night editor’s room. The windows were
open, but the chill of the October night was in the air,
and a bit of fire smouldered in the grate. Brant stirred
it into a blaze and was drawing up a chair when Forsyth
entered.</p>

<p>“Good man!” he exclaimed cheerily. “Sit down
and light a fresh cigar while I unfold you a tale. Did
my note stir up your curiosity? or do you disown any
such womanish weakness?”</p>

<p>Brant laughed. “I disown nothing in the way of
weaknesses, and we’ll admit the curiosity, with this
qualification: it isn’t a womanish weakness—on the
contrary, it is altogether masculine. What is the mystery?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>Forsyth took a paper from a pile of exchanges and
ran a blue pencil around an advertisement in the “Personal”
column. “That is the text,” he said. “Read
that, and then I’ll go on and preach my sermon.”</p>

<p>Brant read: “If Mr. George Brant, formerly of Taggett’s
Gulch, Pitkin County, will communicate with
J. B., care of the Herald, Leadville, he will hear of
something to his advantage.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is pointed at my namesake,” he
commented, handing the paper back with an effort at
nonchalance. “I hope he will come in for a good
thing.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” rejoined the editor, smiling inscrutably.
“But wait till you hear the story. Last night, one of
our reporters—Jarvis, you know him—was hobnobbing
with a lot of variety people in one of the private rooms
in Heddrigg’s restaurant. He swears he was sober, but
you can draw your own conclusions as to that when I
tell you that the company withdrew and left him alone
without his knowing it.”</p>

<p>“Sleepy, perhaps,” suggested Brant.</p>

<p>“That is what he says. When he woke up he was
alone, but the box beyond him was occupied by two men
who were talking in whispers. Now Jarvis is a good
fellow, but he is a reporter first, and everything else
afterward, so of course he listened. The men were
arguing about an ‘ad’ in the Leadville Herald, and
Jarvis gathered that it boded ill for one of them,
though he couldn’t tell which one. In the course of
the talk your name was mentioned—oh, yes, it was you,
because they spoke of your boarding place out in Welton
Street,” Forsyth insisted, in rebuttal of Brant’s incredulous
negative, “and Jarvis heard enough to make
him think they meant to do you a mischief.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” Brant interrupted. “What time
of night was this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“I don’t know exactly, but it was between twelve
and two.”</p>

<p>“All right. Go on.”</p>

<p>“That is all. Only, as I say, Jarvis thinks they
mean mischief, though he caught only a few words
pointing to the necessity for haste in what they had to
do. They seemed to be much afraid that you would see
the ‘ad.’”</p>

<p>Brant leaned forward to flick the ash from his cigar.
“I presume Jarvis saw them when they went out.
What did they look like?”</p>

<p>“That is just where the otherwise irreproachable
Jarvis fell down,” said the editor. “He posted himself
conveniently behind the curtains of his box when
they stirred, but unfortunately there is a back door to
Heddrigg’s place, and they used it.”</p>

<p>“Leaving the Herald behind them?” queried
Brant.</p>

<p>“Not much! But Jarvis went through the file and
found the ‘ad’ after he came back here.”</p>

<p>Brant smoked reflectively for a few minutes and
then rose to go.</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you, Forsyth. It was good
of you to give me the pointer.”</p>

<p>The editor made an effort to detain him. “Don’t
be in a hurry; the night is young.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I think I would better be going.”</p>

<p>Forsyth tilted his chair and made a monocle of
one side of his <i>pince nez</i> through which to quiz his
visitor.</p>

<p>“Brant, you are most provokingly cold-blooded,
don’t you know it? Here I have been at the trouble to
put you in the way of opening up a veritable mine of
first-class sensation, and you are going away without so
much as giving me a squint down the shaft thereof. Do
you call that giving a man a fair shake?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Brant sat down again. “What do you want me to
say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Say? Why, everything. Do you know these
men? or is it a case of mistaken identity? Are they
after your scalp? or do you yearn for theirs? Can’t
you open up the blinds and let in a little daylight?”</p>

<p>Brant shook his head. “Not for publication. You
don’t know what you ask, Forsyth.”</p>

<p>“Publication be hanged! Who said anything about
printing it, I’d like to know! Don’t you suppose a
newspaper man has bowels as well as other people? I
didn’t get you up here to work you for the Plainsman.”</p>

<p>“Then that is different,” Brant conceded. “I’ll
tell you what I can, which isn’t much. I have seen
these men; they followed me home last night at midnight.
But if I ever knew them, I have forgotten who
they are. As to the advertisement, I can only guess its
purport. If the guess is right, there is only one man in
Colorado who need be disturbed about it, and he is not
in Denver.”</p>

<p>The editor turned to his desk and ran through a pile
of telegrams, pausing at one dated from Leadville.</p>

<p>“Does that help your guess?” he inquired, handing
the message to Brant.</p>

<p>“Advertiser’s name is John Brinton,” was what
the typewritten line said; and Brant nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, and no; I can’t understand. Forsyth, I am
going out to hunt those fellows down.”</p>

<p>Forsyth looked at his watch. “Will you take a
partner? My rush won’t be on for a couple of hours
yet.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to have you along, if you don’t mind
going into the dog kennels. I can’t promise you a
pleasure trip.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go,” said the editor. “I suppose you
share the opinion of the public, that all newspaper men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
are seasoned rounders; but it is a fiction in my own case—and
in that of many others too, I think.”</p>

<p>They went down together, and in the street Forsyth
asked if it would not be well to take an officer along.
Whereat Brant laughed.</p>

<p>“You forget my errand, don’t you? We might as
well look for these fellows with a file of soldiers at our
backs as with a ‘Bobby’ for an escort. We shall get
around all right by ourselves, and if we should happen
to run afoul of trouble, you just stand from under while
I cover the retreat.”</p>

<p>“Are you armed?” asked Forsyth.</p>

<p>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am not, and I presume it is just as well. I
can’t see four feet in front of me with or without
glasses.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you? Then let me take your arm,” said
Brant, with ready sympathy; and together they turned
down Sixteenth Street to plunge presently into the
depths of the underworld.</p>

<p>For reasons best known to himself, Brant made the
search for the unknown conspirators a very thorough
one. If, as he more than half suspected, one of the
men should turn out to be Harding in disguise, the
solution of the mystery would be reached at once. And
in that case he knew his enemy well enough to be sure
that nothing short of vigorous measures would serve
to beat him off.</p>

<p>As a last resort he could always give the murderer
of Henry Brinton up to justice; but he shrank from
the thought of this as a brave man would scorn to ask
aid in a personal quarrel. Doubtless the wretch deserved
hanging, but the more Brant thought about it
the more he was disinclined to play the part of the
hangman. The alternative was to find Harding and to
warn him once again that his safety lay not in reprisals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
but in putting distance and oblivion between himself
and his accuser.</p>

<p>It was to set the alternative in train that Brant
tramped his companion from dive to den, dragging the
murkiest depths of the pool, and leaving no place unvisited
where he thought there was a chance of unearthing
the plotters.</p>

<p>The search proved fruitless, as it was bound to, since
Harding and Gasset were at that time closeted in the
former’s room in the West Denver <i>Gasthaus</i>; but Brant
did not give over until Forsyth intimated that it was
time for him to go back to his desk. Even then Brant
begged for five minutes in which to ransack yet one
more kennel, and the night editor yielded and went with
him.</p>

<p>It was the place in which Harding had met the man
from Taggett’s Gulch on the day of his return to Denver—an
evil-smelling lair half underground, with a bar
fronting the entrance and a drug-like heaviness in the
air pointing to what was beyond the bar-screened portal.
It was Forsyth’s earliest sniff of an opium hell. He
gasped for breath at the threshold, and had he been
alone would have fled precipitately. As it was, he went
in with Brant and stood at the bar while his companion
searched the rooms beyond.</p>

<p>In a very short time Forsyth began to wish himself
well out of it. First, the bartender scowled at him and
asked what he would take, and when he refused to take
anything, having a just fear that any liquor sold in
such a place would be only less deadly than prussic acid,
there was a stir in a little knot of ruffians clustered at
the other end of the bar.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded one of them, sidling up
with threatenings. “What are ye here for, if ye don’t
buy? Here, barkeep’, hand out the red liquor; this
here gig-lamps is goin’ to set ’em up fer the crowd.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>As he had confessed to Brant, Forsyth was short-sighted
almost to blindness; also, he was unarmed. But
he was no coward, and he pushed the bottle back resolutely
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“The gentleman is mistaken,” he said; “I haven’t
asked any one to drink at my expense, and don’t mean
to.”</p>

<p>Then there was trouble, as a child might have foreseen.
In the midst of it, Forsyth found himself looking
into the barrel of a huge revolver, the weapon thrust so
close that not even his short-sightedness availed to obscure
it. At the same moment there was a stir in the
murky region beyond the bar, a fierce oath followed by
the sharp crack of a pistol, and the ruffian’s weapon
clattered harmless to the floor. Then Forsyth drew
breath of relief, for Brant had thrust him gently aside
and was standing before him.</p>

<p>“That is my bluff, gentlemen,” said the newcomer
quietly. “Would any of you like to call it?”</p>

<p>“Holy Smut, it’s Plucky George!” gasped one in
the rear; and in a twinkling the place was cleared—nay,
more, the scowling bartender himself disappeared as if
by magic.</p>

<p>Brant linked his arm in the editor’s and led him
forth into the clean night air. Neither spoke until they
were nearing the Plainsman building, and then it was
Forsyth who broke the silence.</p>

<p>“You heard what that fellow said, Brant? Are you
really the Silverette man?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t be alarmed; I’ll quit you when I
have seen you safe back to your office.”</p>

<p>Forsyth stopped, swung around, and put his hands
on the stalwart one’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“You are a blessed idiot—no less; and I am minded
to beat you,” he protested. “Why, confound it all,
man, haven’t you just saved my life?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“That is nothing. And, besides, you wouldn’t have
been there if I had not taken you.”</p>

<p>“No more would I; but what of that? Say, Brant,
don’t play the fool. I have known this thing, or suspected
it, from the first, and I’ll leave it to you to say
if it has made any difference with me. I am quite willing
to take you for what you are, and I don’t care a little
curse what you have been. That is no affair of mine,
or of anybody’s else.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? The world doesn’t agree with
you.”</p>

<p>“The world is an impudent busybody,” quoth the
editor, catching step again. “Come up to my pigeon-hole
and tell me all about it. I’ll stave the rush off
while you do it.”</p>

<p>“No, I sha’n’t let you do that, Forsyth; but I shall
come up later on, if you will let me. I’ll own up frankly;
I am in trouble, well up to my neck, and, barring
yourself, there isn’t a soul in Denver that I can talk to.”</p>

<p>“All right; you come up and unload on me. I’ll
look for you about the time the forms go down.”</p>

<p>It was the word fitly spoken, and Brant turned away
with a warm spot in his heart. High ideals and puissant
resolves are all very well in their way, but a single
grain of human sympathy strikes deeper root and bears
better fruit. For the time Brant felt at peace with all
men, and instead of going back to the purlieus to renew
the search for Harding, as he had intended, he went in
quite the opposite direction, being minded to go to his
office and work on the map while he waited on Forsyth’s
leisure. So ran the intention; but at the corner he
came upon Jarvis, and was straightway turned aside to
do a better thing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>“LET THE RIGHTEOUS SMITE ME FRIENDLY”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hello</span>, Brant!” said the reporter. “Been to see
Forsyth?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then you are posted, of course. What do you
think about it?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to think of it yet,” replied
Brant, unwilling to go into details with Jarvis.
“You are sure those fellows were talking about me, and
not about somebody else?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure they were talking about a man named
Brant who boards at Mrs. Seeley’s. That makes the
peg fit the hole, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It seems to. I guess we shall have to call it a mystery,
and hope to learn more about it later on. Going
upstairs?”</p>

<p>“Not just yet; let’s go and liquidate.”</p>

<p>“I don’t drink,” Brant objected.</p>

<p>“The dickens you don’t! Since when?”</p>

<p>“Never mind the date—since I quit.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet money that was no longer ago than yesterday.
Come and take a cigar, then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind doing that, if you are thirsty enough
to drink alone.”</p>

<p>“I am thirsty enough to envy the fellow who went
and got himself drowned in a butt of Malmsey,” rejoined
the reporter, linking arms with Brant and pointing
like a trained retriever for the nearest pothouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“That thirst will be the death of you, my boy, if you
are not careful,” ventured the older sinner, catching
step.</p>

<p>“Don’t you lose any sleep about that. I know
blessed well when to take a drink and when to let it
alone.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have met you before,” said Brant ironically.
“You are one of a fair-sized crowd. The first
‘when’ is whenever you happen to think of it; the
second is when the thing itself is temporarily out of
reach.”</p>

<p>Jarvis whistled derisively, and his retort was out of
the heart of flippancy:</p>

<p>“You missed your calling, old man; your layout is
the Prohibition platform. Why don’t you join the Salvation
Army?”</p>

<p>“For good and sufficient reasons; but that has nothing
to do with your bad habits.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off! You’re a one-horse lay preacher,
that’s what you are! Your theory is all right, but the
wheels won’t go round in practice. Man can’t be a reporter
and not drink.”</p>

<p>“Without knowing more than I have to about the
askings of your job, I’ll venture to dispute that,” Brant
asserted. “According to my notion, a man can’t be the
best of anything so long as he hobnobs with any devil
of appetite.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let up—you make me limp! I’ll bet a gold
mine against a skinny little Indian pony that you’ve got
wickedness enough in your system to cover my one little
weakness like a bedspread and tuck in all around the
edges. Come now, own up.”</p>

<p>But for obvious reasons Brant could not own up;
and since the random thrust found the joint in his harness,
he must needs go dumb. But a little later, when
they were standing together at the bar, he was again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
moved to protest at the spectacle of Jarvis putting absinthe
into his whisky.</p>

<p>“The red liquor is bad enough by itself, my boy,”
he remarked, clipping the end of his cigar, “but the
other is enough worse. It will make an idiot of you before
your time.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; share a man’s hospitality and jump
on his personal preferences all in the same breath. If
you’ve got to reform somebody, why don’t you tackle
that railroad friend of yours over there in the corner?
He is sliding down the stair on the balustrade thereof.
Go over and preach to him, while I see if I can’t rustle
up an eleventh-hour suicide for Forsyth.”</p>

<p>Brant wheeled at the word and saw that which suddenly
buried his own trouble deep under the <i>débris</i> of
a shattered ideal. At a small table in the corner of
the room two men sat playing cards. One of them was
so good a type of his clan that Brant was able to summarize
him tersely in the word “rook.” The other was
Harry Antrim—Antrim, the self-contained, the immaculate,
the very pride and pattern of the well-behaved.
The chief clerk was evidently much the worse
for liquor; his face was flushed, and his hands trembled
when he dealt the cards; but he was sober enough to
recognise Brant when the latter came up and accosted
him.</p>

<p>“It’s about time you were going home, Harry,” he
said. “Get your overcoat, and I’ll walk up with you.”</p>

<p>The obscene bird across the table took Brant’s measure
in a swift glance, and, scenting trouble, sought to
make his peace with the newcomer.</p>

<p>“We were just having a little game for pastime,
you understand—low man pays for the dr—for the
cigars,” he explained.</p>

<p>Brant ignored the peaceful overture and the maker
of it, and asked Antrim what he had done with his coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“It’s all right about the coat,” replied the foolish
one, making a pitiful effort to keep the consonants in
their proper places. “Man don’t need any overcoat in
summer time. Le’s go home.”</p>

<p>Brant saw that the man across the table wore an
overcoat, and that he was sitting upon another.</p>

<p>“I’ll trouble you to let me have my friend’s coat,”
he said mildly, but the cold gray eyes narrowed and shot
a look with the words that made the request a demand.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly, if he is a friend of yours”—the
rook had never laid eyes on Brant before. “But it
wasn’t no brace game; I win it fair enough.”</p>

<p>Brant helped Antrim to his feet and into his coat,
after which he walked him home with no word of inquiry
or reproach. Truly, the foolish one was far
enough beyond the reach of admonition, but he was also
sane enough to appreciate the value of the silence which
is golden, and he made an effort to say as much when
Brant led him into his room and lighted the gas.</p>

<p>“Much obliged, George, for what you haven’t said.”
He steadied himself with his hands on the table and
tried to catch Brant’s eye: “’Nother fellow would’ve
preached, and a sermon isn’t jush what I need.”</p>

<p>“I know that. Good night,” said Brant, and therewith
he left the prisoner of fools to the company of an
accuser which is not to be silenced save by many applications
of the searing iron.</p>

<p>The night editor of the Plainsman was in the midst
of the last batch of copy when Brant redeemed his
promise to return, and Forsyth motioned to a chair.</p>

<p>“Sit down; I’ll be with you in a minute,” he said,
and when the desk was cleared he wheeled the pivot
chair to face his visitor and drew up another for a foot
rest.</p>

<p>“Thanks be; that is the last of it for one more day.
It’s a ‘demnition grind,’ but I suppose that is true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
of every occupation under the sun. Haven’t you found
it so?”</p>

<p>“Honestly, no. I think I am in love with my profession.
If I didn’t have other things to trouble me,
I believe I could go on making maps to the end of the
chapter.”</p>

<p>“You think that now because the drudgery is preferable
to the other things, maybe. Tell me about the
other things.”</p>

<p>“I shall, and I’ll cut it short. You know what the
public knows about George Brant of Silverette and elsewhere,
so we needn’t go into that, though perhaps you
will let me say that I was no worse than other men of
my tribe. I mean by that that I never dealt a brace
game, and I never picked a quarrel of my own motion.”</p>

<p>“These things say themselves. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, one day I came to the end of things. You
may imagine that the life would nauseate any man who
has ever known anything better, and that is what it did
to me. So I turned short, pasted down the old leaf,
and began all over again.”</p>

<p>“So far so good. And then?”</p>

<p>“Then I began to hunger and thirst after respectability,
and a wife, and a home, and all the commonplace
blessings of the well-behaved. And because I
can’t have them I am minded to do a lot of foolish
things.”</p>

<p>The editor removed his glasses and fell to polishing
them absently. “Perhaps you are not willing to pay
the price,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am—if I know my own mind.”</p>

<p>“Then you have found the—what shall we call her?—the
affinity?”</p>

<p>“I have; found her and lost her again.”</p>

<p>“Very few things are lost in this world—beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the hope of finding them again, I mean. What happened?”</p>

<p>“That which was sure to happen, sooner or later.
Her mother found me out and sent me adrift with a
Scotch blessing.”</p>

<p>“H’m! that was a bit hard. Does the young woman
know?”</p>

<p>“That is what I can’t find out, though I am afraid
she does. I met her face to face yesterday, and she
passed me without a word.”</p>

<p>“Which proves nothing more than that she may be
nearsighted. I shouldn’t lose any sleep over that.”</p>

<p>“But I did; I went mad, and spent half the night
in a gambling den.”</p>

<p>“You did? That is the worst thing I know about
you thus far. It was unworthy of you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it? Haven’t I been eating the bread
of bitterness all day?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have; but you will have to eat a
good bit of it before you get through. You say you
are willing to pay the price, but I have my doubts about
that.”</p>

<p>Now Brant could be steel cold in the fiercest fray,
but he was not beyond flinching under a friendly lash.
Forsyth’s doubt whipped him out of his chair, and he
made two or three quick turns up and down the narrow
walkway behind the desk before the pot of passion
boiled over.</p>

<p>“God in heaven, Forsyth, you don’t know what you
are talking about!” he burst out. “I’d sell my soul
and the reversion of it to win that girl’s love—and respect.”</p>

<p>“Exactly; but you are not required to sell it. You
are expected to pay it out of debt.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to do that. But what can I do more
than I have done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“A great deal, I should say. Let me use the knife
a little, and then I’ll try to sew the wound up. You
went your own way—which you admit was not the way
of decency—till you got tired of it. Then you faced
about and said to yourself that all these things should
be as if they never had been. That was right and
proper, but it was only the first step in a longish journey.
Since that time you have taken several other
steps, and now you have reached a point where society
begins to concern itself, demanding from you a reasonable
guarantee of good faith.”</p>

<p>“Hang society! I suppose that is what the mother
meant when she said I hadn’t repented.”</p>

<p>“She was quite right. You haven’t repented, in the
sense that you are sorry for what you have done. You
were merely tired of one thing and so took up another,
forgetting that in this game of life he who plays must
also pay.”</p>

<p>“I am paying now, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“No, you are not; you are only suffering the consequences
of not having paid.”</p>

<p>Brant made more turns in the narrow walkway, and
scowled and frowned and otherwise gave signs that the
friendly knife had cut deep. It is not every man who
can probe his own wound, but this man did it, as his
silence-breaking word declared:</p>

<p>“Tell me what I am to do, Forsyth, and I’ll do it if
it shortens my life.”</p>

<p>“The thing that you have to do makes for longevity.
It is merely to settle down in humdrum good behaviour
and wait.”</p>

<p>“For how long?”</p>

<p>The editor shrugged. “<i>Quien sabe?</i> Till the price
is paid. Society will let you know when it believes you
are to be trusted.”</p>

<p>Brant sat down again and jammed his hands deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
into his pockets. “Wait, you say. That is the one
thing I can’t do. Set me any task, however desperate,
that I can do and have done with it, and I am your man.
But the waiting game will first drive me mad and then
kill me.”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t. Other men have had it to do.”</p>

<p>“But I shall lose my chance of happiness in any
event.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. Certainly not if the young
woman loves you.”</p>

<p>“You mean that she would wait, too? Possibly she
might, if she knew; but she doesn’t, you know.”</p>

<p>Forsyth shrugged again. “I presume I am a traitor
to my kind for suggesting it, but you are not under
bonds not to tell her, are you?”</p>

<p>“No; I might have been, if the mother had seen
fit to put it that way. But she didn’t. She declared
open war, and she needn’t complain if I borrow her
weapons.”</p>

<p>“No. And there is little doubt about your being
able to hold your own in any stand-up fight. By the
way, speaking of fights, did you shoot that fellow who
was trying to bully me?”</p>

<p>“No; I shot his pistol out of his hand.”</p>

<p>“Purposely?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“It is a sheer marvel to me, the accuracy and the
fact itself. I don’t understand how you managed to hit
it; and I didn’t suppose a bullet would knock a pistol
out of a man’s hand.”</p>

<p>“It is easy enough if you shoot straight and carry
heavy metal. This thing”—he took Harding’s revolver
out of his pocket—“this thing throws a forty-five,
and it would punch boiler plate at that distance.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it,” said Forsyth, and he took the weapon
and examined it as one examines the tools of an unfamiliar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
trade. “It’s a young cannon, isn’t it? What
is this name on the handle?”</p>

<p>“‘J. Harding’ is what it is meant for. He owned
it until one night when I held him up and took it away
from him.”</p>

<p>“Another battle royal, I suppose,” said the editor,
shaking his great head in deprecation of battles royal
and brawlings general. “You will have to drop all
that, my boy, if you are going to join the great army of
the well-behaved. And that reminds me, what kind of
a coil are you in with these fellows that Jarvis overheard?”</p>

<p>Brant thought twice before he spoke once. Here
was a matter about which the least said would be the
soonest mended. If he should tell the facts in the
case, Forsyth would insist that he was no better than an
accessory after the fact if he should persist in his refusal
to give Harding up to justice, and this he could not
bring himself to do. Therefore he answered lightly:</p>

<p>“It is an old quarrel, and one which I don’t mean to
take up. One of the fellows owes me a grudge, but he
is in no condition to go to war with me—or with any
one.”</p>

<p>“And yet you wanted to find him?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I was going to invite him to drop it and go
away, but it’s hardly worth while,” said Brant, getting
up to take his leave before he should be drawn into the
giving of details.</p>

<p>“Well, keep out of it—keep out of everything that
isn’t as plain as print and of a nature to be cried from
the housetops, and you will come out all right. Don’t
get downhearted, or, if you do, just come up here and
I’ll abuse you some more. Good night.”</p>

<p>Brant went down the stairs and out into the street,
and so on up to Mrs. Seeley’s, with his square jaw set
and two ideas dominating all others in his thoughts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
One was that without Dorothy’s love to sustain him he
would be unequal to the task of maintaining the long
probationary struggle outlined by Forsyth; and the
other was an intense longing, born of the militant soul
of him, to be given some desperate penance—to be tried
by the fire of some crucial test which, should it leave
him but a single day to glory in the victory, would
prove him once for all a man and a gentleman, worthy
to have lived and loved.</p>

<p>This he yearned for, and, yearning, put it aside, little
knowing that he had within the hour reached and
passed the parting of the ways, or that his feet were already
in the path leading straight to the goal of his
soul’s desire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE LEADING OF THE BLIND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morrow’s morning Brant went to his work
with a choir of new resolves making melody in his heart.
He would get speech with Dorothy by fair means or
other and make a frank avowal of his love, telling her
what she should know of his past, and pleading only for
the time wherein to make good his promises of amendment.
Then he would settle down to his work, walking
straitly and shunning even the appearance of evil
through the weeks or months or years of his probation.
And in the end he would win her and wear her in the
face of all the world, and none should say him nay.</p>

<p>Thus he planned as he bent over the drawing-board,
etching in the scheme of the future while he traced the
intricate lines of the map. From summarizing he presently
came down to the successive steps in the outworking
of the problem, and then he remembered that he
still held the money won in the night of madness at
Draco’s. Then and there he determined to return it,
whether the chief gambler would or no, and on the heels
of this resolve came a nobler. He would draw out of
his bank balance every dollar that had not come to
him hallowed by honest toil, and, since it was manifestly
impossible to make individual restitution, he would
give the money to some worthy charity.</p>

<p>Being a man of action, he did not suffer the good
resolution to cool by delay. Within the hour he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
made a deposit in his bank, purchased New York exchange
for the amount won at Draco’s, and cashed his
check for six hundred and eight dollars and fifteen
cents, the exact sum with which he had left Silverette
on the night of the tragedy. Then he begged a sheet
of paper and an envelope from the cashier and scribbled
a note to Draco:</p>

<p>“Here is the money which you refused to take back
the other night,” he wrote. “It is not yours, but it is
still less mine, and I don’t want it. I have put it into
New York exchange, so you will know it is out of my
hands. Keep it, or throw it away, as you please.”</p>

<p>That done, he began to wonder what he should do
with the six hundred odd dollars. There were worthy
charities a-plenty, but he shrank equally from giving
without explanations and from telling any part of his
story to a stranger, however charitable or devout. Since
it had to be done, he finally chose Dorothy’s clergyman
as his beneficiary, and, having so decided, sought out
the address and boarded a street car for the house of
the minister. A servant answered the bell, and, in
reply to Brant’s inquiry, sent him across the street to
the church.</p>

<p>“You’ll find the study at the back,” she said. “If
Mr. Crosswell ain’t there, you can go in and wait. He’ll
not be long gone.”</p>

<p>Brant did as he was directed, and when his tap at the
half-open door was unanswered, he went in. A young
woman was sitting in a corner reading, and when he
saw that it was Dorothy he stood abashed like any
schoolboy. Only for a moment, however, for Dorothy
rose quickly and came forward with hands outstretched.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Brant, you fairly startled me! I heard
you at the door and thought it was Mr. Crosswell. How
do you do? and where have you been all these weeks?”</p>

<p>Brant went dizzy with mingled joy and self-reproach.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Then it was a hideous mistake, after all, and
Mrs. Langford had kept her own counsel. It was almost
beyond belief, and he stammered helplessly in his
acknowledgments:</p>

<p>“I—I haven’t been anywhere—that is, I’ve been
here—no, not just here, either——”</p>

<p>Dorothy’s laugh rang sweet and joyous, and it outran
her words in restoring his self-possession.</p>

<p>“It’s the atmosphere of the place, you know,” she
said archly. “People come here to confess their sins,
and polite excuses are not allowed. Have you come to
confession, Mr. Brant?”</p>

<p>Her jesting question went near enough to the truth
to make him wince.</p>

<p>“Ye—yes; something of that sort. I came to have
a little talk with Mr.—Mr.——”</p>

<p>“Crosswell?” she suggested. “So did I. Won’t
you sit down and wait for him? He will be in before
very long, I think.”</p>

<p>Brant did as he was bidden, and thus having the
opportunity for free speech which he would have been
willing to buy at a price, went dumb and could do no
more than tie idle knots in his watch chain. Dorothy
read the questions in his eyes, but she mistook their
pointing, and wondered how she could help matters
along without betraying Isabel. Much to her relief, he
opened the way by breaking ground in the direction of
things serious.</p>

<p>“The last time we met you were in trouble,” he began.
“I hope the cause has been removed.”</p>

<p>“It has,” she assented; “and—and I have wanted
so much to thank you. It was very, very good of you to
help us.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t mention it; any one would have done
as much under the circumstances,” he protested, adding,
“and that without the hope of reward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>She knew what he meant, or thought she did, and
steeled herself to lead him on.</p>

<p>“I think we all expect rewards of some kind for our
good deeds, and we usually get them, don’t we?”</p>

<p>“Rather oftener than we deserve, I think. But I
missed mine.”</p>

<p>Dorothy had prayed for this opportunity, and for
strength to improve it, but she had to turn away from
him before she could go on.</p>

<p>“Sometimes we think we have lost things when we
have only overlooked them,” she ventured; then, brushing
aside the figure of speech, she went straight to the
heart of the matter. “Mr. Brant, why don’t you come
to see us any more?”</p>

<p>From the personal point of view it was the cruelest
of questions, but she was determined to secure her own
safety and Isabel’s happiness by forcing his confidence,
and she knew no better way to do this. Nevertheless,
she was wholly unprepared for his reply.</p>

<p>“For the best of reasons, Miss Langford: I have
been forbidden the house.”</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that he should put such a harsh
construction upon Isabel’s refusal, and Dorothy was
bewildered. “But I don’t understand,” she began.
“Surely——”</p>

<p>“One moment, please. Do you believe in repentance?”</p>

<p>“In its efficacy, you mean? Why, certainly; otherwise
we should all be beyond hope.”</p>

<p>“Then let me suppose a case—call it a parable, if
you will. There was once a man who was thoroughly
bad; quite given over to the service of the Evil One.
One day this man saw the error of his way and resolved
to live thenceforth a clean life. Then he met and loved
a woman”—he paused and got up to pace slowly back
and forth behind her chair—“loved her with a love that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
recked nothing of the great gulf separating him from
her; forgetting the gulf, indeed, until the spectre of his
evil past was called up to remind him of his unworthiness.
Do you follow me?”</p>

<p>Her “Yes” was the faintest of whispers, but he
heard it and went on.</p>

<p>“Judge, then, between that man and an exacting
world. Is there any hope for such a one? Would patient
perseverance in well-doing some time earn him the
right to contend for such a prize as the love of a good
woman? Might he venture to look forward to a time
when the great gulf would be fairly bridged—when a
pure woman, knowing the worst of him, would not turn
from him in loathing?”</p>

<p>Dorothy rose and faced him with the light of self-sacrifice
shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Who am I that I should judge any one?” she
asked softly.</p>

<p>“You are yourself, Dorothy; and you know the
man—and the woman.”</p>

<p>It was a moment of supreme trial. How could she
give him the word of encouragement from Isabel without
betraying Isabel’s secret? And how could she ever
forgive herself if she should waste the opportunity and
send him away empty-handed. In her embarrassment
she again took counsel of frankness.</p>

<p>“It is only the faint-hearted who despair,” she said
steadily. “Difficulties are made to be overcome, and
for one who presses forward steadfastly there is always
hope.” She stopped with the feeling that all these
phrasings were but generalities, and he broke in
eagerly:</p>

<p>“That is enough. You have heard the parable;
this is the interpretation. I am the man, Dorothy, and
you——”</p>

<p>“Are the woman,” he was going to say, but she held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
up a warning finger, and he heard a step at the door. It
was the clergyman returning, and before Brant could
add the word to which all the other words had been but
the preface his chance was gone. The next moment
Dorothy was introducing him to an elderly little man
with a kindly face and a hand-clasp that spoke of warm
friendships and a broad personality.</p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you, Mr. Brant—always glad
to know any friend of Miss Dorothy’s. Sit down—sit
down, both of you, and let us be comfortable.”</p>

<p>Brant obeyed, but Dorothy hesitated.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you a moment about the Crowleys,”
she said. “They are in trouble again, and this time it
is beyond me. Mr. Brant wishes to see you about another
matter, and if you can give me a minute——”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly; Mr. Brant will excuse us,”
and they went apart to discuss the case of the unfortunate
Crowleys, while Brant took up a book and pretended
to read. Presently Dorothy took her leave, giving
her hand to Brant at parting and inviting him to
call soon at Hollywood.</p>

<p>He told no lie in saying that he should be glad to,
and he tried to say with his eyes that other thing which
had been denied lip utterance. Dorothy flushed faintly
under his gaze and her hand trembled a little in his;
whereupon he made bold to revert to the object of their
common solicitude in another offer of assistance.</p>

<p>“About William: be sure to command me if I
can ever help you again. I hope the occasion won’t
arise, but if it does, you must manage to let me know at
once.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I shall,” she rejoined gratefully. “But
you must come to see us. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>When she was gone the clergyman drew up his chair
opposite Brant’s. “A most devoted young woman,”
he said with kindly emphasis. “I don’t know how we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
should get along in the parish without her. Have you
known the Langfords long?”</p>

<p>“Not very long; no.”</p>

<p>“Charming family—that is—er—all but the boy.
He is a little wild, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Brant. He was finding his introduction
by Dorothy a very considerable hindrance to his
errand.</p>

<p>“The judge knows it, and tries to do what he can,”
Mr. Crosswell went on, following out his own line of
thought. “But Mrs. Langford puts the lad on a pedestal
and so spoils him. But pardon me, you came on an
errand of your own, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Brant braced himself and took the simplest
way out of the entanglement. “You probably
have many ways in which you can use money for charitable
purposes, haven’t you, Mr. Crosswell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. You are always safe to assume that
in the case of a working clergyman,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I supposed so. I have some money here”—taking
the roll of bills from his pocket—“which is, in a certain
sense, what you might call conscience money.
Would you object to adding it to your charity fund?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, if it be truly conscience money. But
you must give me some assurance that it is—that there
is no possibility of restitution to the proper parties.”</p>

<p>“There is none whatever. It is money which was
won across the gaming table—not recently,” he added,
in deference to the look of pained surprise in the kindly
eyes, “but some months ago. I don’t know what else
to do with it, and it will be truly an act of charity to me
if you will take it.”</p>

<p>“Under those circumstances I shall be quite willing
to disburse it for you, Mr. Brant. It is very commendable
in you to take such an honourable view of the matter—a
thing as commendable as it is rare, I assure you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>But Brant could not let that stand. “It is a simple
matter of justice, and I am afraid the motive is purely
selfish. To be very frank about it, the stuff burns my
fingers.”</p>

<p>“A most hopeful sign, my dear sir,” said the little
clergyman, warming to Brant as most good people did,
without any reason that could be set in words. “It is
not often that we are given to see such practical proofs
of repentance.”</p>

<p>Being an honest man in the better sense of the
word, Brant made haste to remove the false impression:</p>

<p>“Don’t misunderstand me. I am not at all sure
that I am repentant in your meaning of the word; in
fact, I am quite sure I am not. I drank the cup of evil
living to the dregs, and the dregs nauseated me—that
is all.”</p>

<p>“But that is a very good beginning—very good, indeed,”
asserted the clergyman benignly. “Go on as
you have begun, and we shall see better things; I am
quite sure of that.”</p>

<p>Brant remembered his desperate plunge of less than
forty-eight hours before, and smiled.</p>

<p>“It is very evident that you haven’t sounded all the
depths of wickedness in the human heart, Mr. Crosswell,
and perhaps it is just as well for us sinners that
you haven’t. We are a sorrier lot than you have any
idea of, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“We are all ‘vile earth’ when it comes to that, Mr.
Brant; but I shall continue to consider your case as a
most hopeful one.” Then, as Brant found his hat,
“Must you go? Come and see me often. I want to
know more of you.”</p>

<p>Brant bowed himself out and went his way musing.
As he approached the side gate giving upon the street,
a carriage drew up to the curb and a lady descended
therefrom. He had opened the gate for her and lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
his hat before he saw that it was Mrs. Langford; but in
any case he could have done no less. Notwithstanding,
her chilling stare cut him to the quick, and he went
back to his office with the comfortable feeling of elation
engendered by the meeting with Dorothy and the
act of restitution somewhat dashed by the chance encounter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Langford had entered the study
and made known her errand, which was to call for
Dorothy.</p>

<p>“She said she wouldn’t wait,” explained the clergyman.
“Mr. Brant was here, waiting to see me about a
matter which was—ah—er—a matter which I presume
Miss Dorothy knew to be private, and so she kindly
made room for him.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brant!” Mrs. Langford’s frown was quite
portentous. “Do you mean to say they were here
together, Mr. Crosswell?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; that is, I—er—I found them both here
when I came in.” Then, as the lines of displeasure
deepened in the lady’s brow, he tried to set himself
right by adding: “A most excellent young man, Mrs.
Langford; I am glad to know that he is a friend of the
family.”</p>

<p>“He is not,” she rejoined with aggressive emphasis.
“He was never more than a calling acquaintance, and
he is not even that at present. I have forbidden him
the house.”</p>

<p>“Forbidden him the house?” echoed the good man
in unfeigned astonishment. “May I—may I ask your
reason?”</p>

<p>“You may; and I will tell you, if you will tell me
what he was doing here.”</p>

<p>“He came on a very worthy errand, I assure you,
Mrs. Langford; he came to devote a certain sum of
money to charitable objects—money acquired in a manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
which is all too common in this our day and generation,
but which he felt that he could not conscientiously
keep.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Some of the proceeds of his gambling, I
suppose. It was a mere trick, Mr. Crosswell, and I
hope you won’t let him impose upon you. I know his
whole history, and it is thoroughly bad and disgustingly
disreputable.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear madam, are we not commanded——”</p>

<p>“I know what you would say,” she broke in, with
her hand on the door. “But you know my views, Mr.
Crosswell. If a woman had done the tenth part of the
evil things this man has, you would be the first to
recommend sackcloth and ashes and a sisterhood, if not
a solitary cell.”</p>

<p>The indignant lady swept down the walk and
stepped into her carriage. “Conscience money, indeed!”
she said to herself. “It is much more likely
that he made the whole thing an excuse to get a chance
to talk to Dorothy. Well, I’ll put a stop to that!”</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Langford’s carriage turned and
rolled away, the good little man stood in the doorway
of his study and shook his head sadly to the tune of a
musing commentary on his latest visitor.</p>

<p>“Strange, passing strange, that she can be so uncharitable,
when her own son stands so sorely in need
of the broadest charity! I do hope there is no dreadful
day of retribution in store for her, but it is certainly
tempting Providence to be so pitiless.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>THE DEMONIAC</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rounds in the descending ladder of dissipation
are many or few according to the temperament of the
man who makes use of them: the man, I say, for
women rarely descend—they fall. As in a galloping
consumption it is not infrequently the strongest who
succumb first, so in a moral lapse it is often the self-contained
who set the pace.</p>

<p>Antrim’s sudden plunge into the stream of excess
was fairly illustrative of this. Beginning with the
mild debauch in the company of Grotter, the division
engineer, he went from bad to worse with such breathtaking
celerity that the end of a single week found
him shattered and nerveless, and already dependent
upon stimulants for the inspiration needful to keep him
up to his work.</p>

<p>It was in such a plight that he began the day following
his adventure with the “rook.” To be sure, there
were, early in the morning, some feeble and shame-prompted
motions toward amendment, but these were
soon swept away by the onrush of appetite, newborn
but mighty; and since he went fasting to his work, he
began the earlier to borrow efficiency from the bottle.</p>

<p>As it is prone to do in time of need, the stimulant
played him false at first, though he gauged the doses
with careful accuracy and repeated them frequently.
All through the forenoon he found himself struggling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
with a vague sense of uncertainty, a mental obscuration
which made perplexing puzzles out of the well-known
details of the office work. The mail was heavy that
day, and in the absence of the superintendent the
chief clerk’s tasks were multiplied. There was an unusual
influx of callers, each with a grievance real or
fancied, and a dribbling stream of telegrams trickled
insistently through the clicking relay on his desk. To
make a bad matter worse, his telegraph operator was
sick, and such wire business as came to the office he had
to handle himself.</p>

<p>It was some time during this hazy interval that a
message, repeated from some station on the Eastern
Division, came from the despatcher’s office at Lone Pine
Junction. It was from the general manager, who, with
the president and his party in the private car Aberystwyth,
was on the line moving westward. Some
member of the party was sick, and in consequence the
car was running as a special train, with orders giving
it right of way over all other trains. Similar orders
were required for the Western Division, and Antrim
turned to the stenographer:</p>

<p>“Take a message to the general manager, care car
Aberystwyth, running as special train on Eastern Division,”
he directed; and when Bertram’s pencil
stopped, he dictated:</p>

<p>“Your message to-day. Car Aberystwyth will be
run as special train on Western Division, Lone Pine
Junction to Denver, with right of way over all trains.”</p>

<p>“Get that off as quick as you can, and when you
come back I’ll give you the letter to the despatcher,” he
said, and a few minutes later Bertram took the message
to the telegraph office.</p>

<p>When he came back Antrim had something else for
him to do, and in the rush of the forenoon’s work the
stenographer forgot all about the letter to the train despatcher—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> 
letter without which the despatcher
would know nothing about the arrangement made for
the special. But if Bertram forgot, so did the chief
clerk, though the omission hung over Antrim like a
vague threat, which he tried vainly to define. At noon
the threat had become a part of the general obscurity
through which he seemed to be groping his way, and by
that time he was so far behind with the business of the
day that he went without dinner to save the noon hour,
substituting yet other potations for the midday meal.</p>

<p>Such reckless disregardings of the simple necessities
speedily brought their own penalties. By half
past one o’clock he was little better than an automaton,
doing whatever came to hand mechanically and by
force of long habit. By three he had fairly entered the
drunkard’s paradise—that exalted frame of mind in
which the most abstruse problems seem to solve themselves
of their own motion. After that, all things were
easy of accomplishment, and the chief clerk shut and
locked his office at six o’clock with the comforting conviction
that he was quite himself again; that, notwithstanding
the perplexities of the morning, he had acquitted
himself with his old-time vigour and perspicacity.</p>

<p>Then he went to supper, and when he found that he
had overshot the mark and could eat nothing, he began
dimly to realize that he was in a bad way and forced
himself to drink a double allowance of strong coffee.
The slight stimulant began presently to counteract the
effect of the greater, and with the first gleams of returning
sobriety the threat of the forenoon renewed
itself with added insistence.</p>

<p>When that happened he went to his room and sat
down on the edge of the bed to reason it out. For an
hour or more he wrestled with the thing, coming no
nearer the truth than this: that out of the struggle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
came a great and growing conviction that he had left
something of critical moment undone. That was
enough. Things left undone in a railway superintendent’s
office may easily mean anything in the category
of disaster, and Antrim groped for his hat and
coat and went out, meaning to borrow yet again of the
usurer, and then to go back to his office to search for
the slipped cog.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the latter resolve, the brisk walk in
the cool night air sobered him sufficiently to send him
straight to the office without the preliminary. Letting
himself in and leaving the door ajar, he turned the key
of the incandescent lamp over his desk and sat down to
go painfully over the business of the day. It was slow
work. His fingers were clumsy, and there was a curious
haze before his eyes which seemed to befog the
mental as well as the physical vision. Under such conditions
it was not wonderful that he overlooked the
message relating to the movements of the president’s
special train; and when he had gone through the day’s
correspondence without discovering anything amiss, he
was dismayed afresh to find that the threat of impending
disaster was increased rather than diminished, and
his pulse quickened with a rising fever of apprehension.</p>

<p>“Oh, good Lord,” he groaned, “what has come
over me that I can’t remember? I know I’ve missed
something—something that will drive me crazy if I
can’t find out what it is. Let me think: there was the
Rowland excursion to arrange—that’s done; and the
holding of Number Seven for the Western mail—I did
that, too.” He went on through the day’s routine,
checking off the items one by one. “No, it’s something
else, and it’s gone from me—gone as though it never
were. And whatever it is, it will ruin me, world without
end. God of mercy, why can’t I remember?”</p>

<p>He leaned back in the swing chair and tortured his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
brain once again—cudgelled it until the sweat stood in
great drops on his forehead, but all to no purpose.
Once he started up with the thought that he would try
to find Bertram, but he knew not where to look for the
stenographer, and, besides, the nameless terror seemed
now to be so close at hand as to forbid all expedients
asking for time. This menacing phase of the unexplainable
thing made him sick with fear, and the sickness
made him sit down and sweat again and fight
desperately for consciousness.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, while he sat staring blankly
at the opposite wall, the end came. Having dwelt overmuch
upon the day’s routine, the events of it now began
to chase each other in a round of endless repetition.
In this rhythmic round things tangible were presently
involved, first the walls of the room, then the furniture.
He caught at the arms of his chair to save himself from
slipping into the vortex of the spinning whirlpool:
something clicked, in his brain or out of it, the twirling
maelstrom vanished in a puff of darkness that could be
felt, and silence as profound as that in which the deaf
live seemed to kill the sense of hearing.</p>

<p>How long he sat horror-sick in the stifling darkness
he knew not; it might have been minutes or hours.
Then a familiar sound broke the stillness, and he listened
with the keen joy of one who hears the babble of
running water in a thirsty desert. It was the clicking
of the telegraph instrument on his desk, and the tiny
tapping was his first assurance that he had not been
stricken both deaf and blind in the same instant. At
first the clicking spatter of dots and dashes was meaningless;
then it slipped into coherence, and Antrim listened
with his heart pounding like a trip hammer.
The sounder was repeating the wire business of the day.</p>

<p>Like a flash out of the unseen it came to the prisoner
of despair that the thing forgotten had to do with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
some telegram mislaid or overlooked, and here was his
opportunity. Sooner or later the tapping sounder
would give him the lost clew, and he would lie in wait
and listen and pounce upon it.</p>

<p>One by one the messages received hours before were
ticked off into the silence, and so single-eyed was the
listener that it did not occur to him to marvel at the
miracle. Word for word they came, and he could even
recognise the varying “writing” of the different operators
on the line. At length there was a pause, and then
the sounder began again, tapping out the Denver office
call with the signature of Lone Pine Junction. Antrim
pounced upon the key and answered. Without a
break the message followed the closing of the key:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To <span class="smcap">Craig</span>, Superintendent, Denver:</p>

<p>“Owing to sudden illness of a member of the president’s
party, we are running private car Aberystwyth
as special train with right of way against all other
trains. Make same arrangement for Western Division.
Must reach Denver at earliest possible moment.
On present schedule, will arrive Lone Pine
Junction between nine and ten this <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span></p>

<p class="right">“R. F. <span class="smcap">Angus</span>, G. M.”</p>
</div>

<p>Antrim heard it through, opened his key and sent
the reply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To R. F. <span class="smcap">Angus</span>, General Manager, care car Aberystwyth,
running as special train on Eastern Division:</p>

<p>“Your message to-day. Car Aberystwyth will be
run as special train on Western Division, Lone Pine
Junction to Denver, with right of way over all trains.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Craig</span>, Superintendent.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then he felt in the darkness for the pad of letter-heads,
dipped the pen, and began the forgotten letter of
instructions to the train despatcher:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“<span class="smcap">Disbrow</span>, Despatcher, Denver:</p>

<p>“President Carothers, with his party in private car
Aberystwyth, is moving westward on Eastern Division.
A member of the party is sick, and car is running special
to Denver with regardless orders. This special
will reach——”</p>
</div>

<p>The chief clerk stopped with suspended pen and
tried to recall the name of Lone Pine Junction.
Though he had but now repeated it, it was gone, and,
balanced as he was upon the sharp edge of collapse, the
effort to remember the name turned the scale. The
pen slipped from his fingers, his head sank upon his
arm, and the swirling whirlpool laid hold of him,
thrusting him down to oblivion in the black throat of
its vortex.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>“A ROD FOR THE FOOL’S BACK”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Comparing</span> it with the fortnight of yesterdays,
Brant reckoned the day of his meeting with Dorothy as
one worthy of anniversaries. In good truth, his confession
had stopped something short of its climax, and
of the coveted personal absolution; but it was comforting
to remember that he had spoken plainly, and that
she had bidden him go forward hopefully. Notwithstanding
the untimely interruption, there could be no
reasonable doubt of the major fact: that she fully understood
his parable and its application—understood
and was glad, and would have let him go on but for the
interruption.</p>

<p>So much for the good; and as for the ill, the rebuff
at the church gate went for little. Being so well assured
of the daughter’s—he was about to say “love,”
but he changed it to “sympathy”—being so well assured
of the daughter’s sympathy, he could afford to
wait for reinstatement in the good graces of the
mother. Women, even such women as the Mrs. Langfords,
are not implacable, he reasoned; and when he
should have shown how sincere he was, her resentment—her
natural resentment, he was willing to call it—would
be allayed, and she would see the injustice of
her sentence of ostracism. Wherein he showed forth
an unknowledge of womankind common to very
young men, and to some older ones whose walk in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
life has led them much apart from women worth the
knowing.</p>

<p>In the exuberance of his self-congratulation Brant
lost sight of the one redeeming thread in the thought-woven
fabric of the day, which thread was a brotherly
concern for Antrim, and a half-formed resolve to turn
bearwarden to the foolish one. By evening the half-formed
resolve took permanent shape; and since a
physician must first know something of the disease and
the cause of it, he began by trying to breach Antrim’s
reticence at the supper table. For reasons good and
sufficient, the effort was bootless; and Brant, driven
from ear to eye evidence, and having, moreover, considerable
skill in diagnosing the symptoms of bottle
sickness, saw with concern that Antrim was tottering
on the verge of the abyss.</p>

<p>From that to keeping a solicitous eye on him was
but a step; and when Antrim went upstairs, Brant,
whose room was just across the corridor from the chief
clerk’s, went too, mounting guard with a light, a book,
and with his door ajar. For a long time there was no
stir in the opposite room; but just as he was beginning
to hope that Antrim had gone to bed, the door opened
and the chief clerk hurried out.</p>

<p>Brant’s first impulse was to follow and bring him
back without ceremony. Then he reflected that it is
an ill thing to meddle, even with the best of motives,
and so cast about for a plausible excuse. Luckily, he
found one ready to his hand. The papers containing
the evidence against Harding were in the drawer of his
writing table, and in view of the late stirrings in that
pool it would be well to put them under lock and key.
There was a safe in Antrim’s office, and the errand
would give him a chance to probe Antrim’s wound, and
so haply he might find the bullet or the arrowhead, or
whatever it might be that was rankling therein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>So he put the papers in his pocket and went out;
and taking it for granted that Antrim would make
straight for the nearest barroom, lost a half hour
or more in a fruitless search among the drinking
places. When he had widened the search circle to
the farthest limits of the <i>quasi</i>-respectable district, outside
of which Antrim would not be likely to venture,
he stumbled upon Jarvis and stopped to inquire
of him.</p>

<p>“Say, Jarvis, have you seen anything of Harry
Antrim this evening?”</p>

<p>The reporter nodded. “Um-hm; saw him heading
for his office half an hour ago, plugging along with his
head down and his hands in his pockets. What’s
struck him lately?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the bearwarden truthfully
enough; “much obliged.” But when he would have
gone on, Jarvis turned and went with him.</p>

<p>“Going to hunt him up? I’ll mog along with you.
The old man says the president of the C. E. &amp; W. is
coming in on a special, and I’d like to get the facts for
an item.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you telephone?” asked Brant, remembering
the nature of his errand.</p>

<p>“I suppose I could, but I don’t mind the walk.
Say, it’s queer about Harry, isn’t it? Never saw a man
let go all holds at once like he has.”</p>

<p>“He will get over it; it’s nothing worse than a fit
of the blues,” said Brant, taxing his ingenuity meanwhile
for an expedient which would rid him of the reporter.</p>

<p>“Blues nothing! Fit of the ‘jimmies,’ if he doesn’t
pull up pretty short. He isn’t built right to carry bug
juice in bulk, and that is just about what he is trying
to do.”</p>

<p>“What was it you said to me about preaching last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
night?” asked Brant, as they climbed the stair to
the railway offices.</p>

<p>“Never mind about that; you were preaching at
me, and I didn’t need it. Now, with a fellow like
Harry it’s different——”</p>

<p>They were at the door of the train despatcher’s
room, and Brant paused. “Better ask Disbrow about
the special,” he said, with a glance at the darkened
transom of the superintendent’s office. “Harry
doesn’t seem to be here.”</p>

<p>The reporter acted upon the suggestion; and when
he was alone in the corridor Brant went quickly to the
door of the darkened office. It was ajar, and when
he pushed it open the light from the hall fell full upon
the figure of the chief clerk lying inert and helpless
across the open desk.</p>

<p>Brant took in the situation at a glance, closed the
door softly, and walked back toward the despatcher’s
room. Jarvis was a good fellow, but he already knew
too much about Antrim’s affair, and he must be got
rid of at all hazards. He met the reporter as the latter
was coming out of Disbrow’s door.</p>

<p>“Get what you wanted?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No. You railroad fellows are all of a piece
when it comes to giving up anything that the public
would care to read about. Disbrow says he doesn’t
know anything about a special train—didn’t know
the president was coming. Between you and me
and the gatepost, I think he doesn’t know much of anything.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to forego the item.”</p>

<p>“Forego nothing! I’ll hang around this old shack
till morning, now, but what I’ll find out about that
train.”</p>

<p>Brant laughed. “I like your persistence, even if it
is a little out of proportion to the object. Come into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
my office here and sit down and smoke a cigar while I
try my hand at it. I owe you a good turn, anyway.”</p>

<p>Brant unlocked the door of the chief engineer’s
rooms, and, telling the reporter to make himself comfortable
while he waited, left him. But since it was
no time for half measures he took the precaution to set
the catch of the nightlatch as he closed the door, locking
Jarvis in.</p>

<p>Hurrying back to the superintendent’s office, he
turned on the light and tried to rouse Antrim, shaking
him roughly and sparing neither blows nor abuse.
Nothing coming of this, he was beginning to despair of
any measure of success which should antedate the end
of the reporter’s patience, when his eye lighted upon the
unfinished letter to the train despatcher. Written as
it had been, in the dark, it was a barely legible scrawl,
but he made shift to decipher it, pieced it out with Jarvis’s
information and Disbrow’s ignorance, and knowing
much more about building railways than about
operating them, jumped at once to the conclusion that
the special train was rushing onward to certain destruction.
Wherefore he forgot the imprisoned reporter,
overlooked the very obvious expedient of notifying the
despatcher by word of mouth, and fell upon Antrim
with renewed buffetings to which the assumed exigencies
lent stinging vigour.</p>

<p>No sudorific could hold out long against such an
heroic antidote, and with the first signs of returning
consciousness Brant dragged his patient to the wash
basin in the corner of the room and held his head under
the cold faucet. Antrim came up gasping and struggled
feebly with his tormentor, but Brant thrust him
down again and held him until he found speech and
sanity wherewith to protest.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, let up—you’ll drown me!”
gasped the victim, and Brant desisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Got your grip again so it will stay?” he inquired
grimly.</p>

<p>Antrim staggered back against the wall and groped
for the towel which Brant handed him.</p>

<p>“I should hope so. What’s the matter? What
have you been doing to me?”</p>

<p>“Matter enough. Drop that towel and come over
here.” Brant was dragging him back to the desk.
“Read that letter, quick, and tell me what to do, before
somebody gets killed!” he commanded.</p>

<p>Antrim sank into the chair. “Great Scott! I feel
as if I had been brayed in a mortar!” he groaned.
Then he took up the letter and read it.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Brant impatiently. “Pull your
wits together and tell me what I am to do—or is it too
late to do anything?”</p>

<p>The chief clerk blinked at the clock and was evidently
unable to see its dial. “Will you tell me what
time it is?” he said. “I can’t seem to see very well.”</p>

<p>“It is ten minutes past nine.”</p>

<p>“‘Between nine and ten,’ he said,” muttered Antrim,
quoting the misplaced message. Then to Brant:
“Maybe there is time enough. Can you run a typewriter,
Brant?”</p>

<p>“Yes—after a fashion.”</p>

<p>“Then let me give you a letter. I couldn’t write it
with a pen to save my life.”</p>

<p>Brant jerked the cover from the machine and
thrust in a sheet of paper. “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Antrim handed him the unfinished letter.</p>

<p>“Just copy that, if you will, and I’ll tell you what
to add.”</p>

<p>“But, man alive! have we got to sit here and fool
with red tape when every minute may be worth a dozen
lives?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so bad as all that,” said Antrim soberly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
enough. “The train can’t get past Lone Pine without
orders for this division. But I’m a ruined man if Disbrow
doesn’t get that letter before Lone Pine calls him
up. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll explain. The general manager is on
that train, and he wired me this morning for regardless
orders over this division. I answered that they would
be given—and they haven’t been. If there is a balk at
Lone Pine, every operator on the line will know that
some one has fallen down, and you can trust the general
manager to find out who that some one is. And when
he finds out, I’m done.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Brant, and forthwith he turned and
fell upon the typewriter. When he had written to the
break in the unfinished letter, Antrim dictated:</p>

<p>“Will reach Lone Pine Junction between nine and
ten this <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, and you will arrange to give it right of
way to Denver over all other trains.”</p>

<p>Brant finished with a flourish and jerked the sheet
out of the rolls. “Can you make out to sign it?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” responded the chief clerk, and he
dipped his pen and made the supposition good, though
with no little difficulty. “Now, if you will copy it in
that book and tell me how I’m to get it to Disbrow at
this late hour without giving myself away, we’ll see
what comes of it.”</p>

<p>Brant took an impression of the letter, laying his
plans meanwhile.</p>

<p>“Can’t trust Disbrow, I suppose?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; but he will hold it over me.”</p>

<p>“Then we won’t give him a chance. Let me have
an envelope.”</p>

<p>When the letter was inclosed and addressed, Brant
told the chief clerk to sit still and wait for him. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
was back in a few minutes, and Antrim had not to ask
if his errand had been successful.</p>

<p>“How did you manage it?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Never you mind about that. I got two letters
to-day in the train mail that didn’t belong in our
office.”</p>

<p>“Oh. What did Disbrow say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. Swore a little on general principles,
and said it was lucky I found it before the old
man had time to raise Cain. It took me longer because
I had to go and bake it over a gas jet; it was wet, you
know.”</p>

<p>Antrim swallowed a lump in his throat and pulled
himself together to meet the demands of the occasion.</p>

<p>“Brant, you have played the Good Samaritan to-night,
if you never did before. You have pulled me
out of the deepest hole I ever got into.”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t; but I am going to. Now tell me
how the thing happened.”</p>

<p>Antrim told the story of the day’s miseries, concluding
with the curious experience in the darkness.</p>

<p>“It’s all plain enough but the miracle, and that
is beyond me,” he confessed. “Did I know what I was
about? or was I beginning to ‘see things’?”</p>

<p>“A little of both, I guess,” said Brant, and as he
spoke the key of the incandescent lamp snapped and
left them in the darkness. Brant laughed and got up
to turn it on again.</p>

<p>“That is doubtless the snap you heard, and it accounts
for the blindness. As for the rest, your brain
was simply making another hunt for the missing clew.
Does that satisfy you?”</p>

<p>“It will have to, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, it is my turn. I want to know why
you have been making a bally idiot of yourself for the
last week or so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>Antrim hung his head. “Because I haven’t any
better sense, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t go. Give me the facts.”</p>

<p>“There is only one to give: Isabel won’t marry
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she won’t? And so you are going to make a
howling wilderness of yourself because a young woman
doesn’t happen to know her own mind. Is that it?”</p>

<p>“But she does know her own mind,” Antrim protested.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! You are no boy, and you ought
to know better. If you love her—and I take that for
granted—all you have to do is just to hang on and wait;
and that is what you are going to do, if I can make
you.”</p>

<p>Antrim smiled wearily. “The way I feel at this
present moment, anybody could make me do anything.
I am as weak as a cat, and as sore as if I had been
through a prize fight.—What on earth is that?”</p>

<p>“That” was a furious pounding on a near-by door,
and Brant sprang up, oversetting his chair in his haste.</p>

<p>“It’s Jarvis—that’s what it is!” he exclaimed.
“Blest if I didn’t forget all about him! Sit in the dark
a minute, will you?” and he turned off the light and
went to liberate the captive.</p>

<p>“Nice fellow, you are!” began Jarvis wrathfully
when the door was opened. “Lock a man up while
you go off and go to sleep——”</p>

<p>Brant broke in with an apology which ran smoothly
and without a break until he had walked the reporter
down the stair and out into the street. Then he gave
Jarvis the required information about the president’s
special, and hastened back to Antrim to explain the interruption.</p>

<p>“You see, I had to do something with him,” he concluded.
“He is a good fellow, but he talks too much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
and the less said about this business of yours the
better.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” agreed Antrim ruefully, adding,
“but it’s no use; the whole town must know about it
by this time. I haven’t been at it very long, but I
haven’t been hiding my light under a bushel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about the publicity. A man
doesn’t fill the public eye quite as much as he is apt to
think. Besides, you have made your last appearance in
the idiotic rôle. Beginning right now, you are going
to break it short off and be yourself again. When did
you eat last?”</p>

<p>“Supper, last night.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I thought as much. No wonder you
had wheels in your head! Let me help you into your
overcoat, and we’ll go up to Elitch’s.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I could eat anything, if it was to
save my life,” objected Antrim, rising laboriously.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can—you have got to; and then you
are going to let me take you home and put you to bed;
and if we hear of any more foolishness, you will come
in for a manhauling that you won’t get over for a
week.”</p>

<p>Antrim reached backward for the sleeves of the
overcoat and groaned piteously.</p>

<p>“Great Moses! I feel as if I’d had that already.
What the mischief do you suppose makes me so stiff
and sore?”</p>

<p>Brant’s laugh lacked sympathy. “It is one of the
after-effects, I fancy; look out you don’t bring it on
again.” And he tucked Antrim’s arm under his own
and led him uptown, carrying out his programme to the
letter, and playing his new rôle of bearwarden until he
had seen his charge safe in bed.</p>

<p>When he reached his own room he found the packet
of papers still in his pocket and tossed it carelessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
across to the table. Then he thought better of it, and
put the envelope back in his pocket.</p>

<p>“It is climbing into the plane of responsibilities,
and my conscience isn’t clean enough yet to handle it,”
he mused. “Just now I feel as if I should like to
burn the stuff and give the beggar a chance for his life;
and yet I suppose there are plenty of purists who
would say that I am an accessory in the murder of
Henry Brinton for not giving his murderer up to justice.
I wonder what <i>she</i> would say about it? If I
knew, that is what I should do.” He stretched his
arms and yawned sleepily. “Heigho! it’s a queer old
round world, from any point of view; but since the
morning and the evening of this blessed day, I’m rather
glad to be in it.”</p>

<p>With which altruistic reflection he went to bed to
dream that he was about to be hanged for the murder of
one Henry Brinton.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>HOW THE SMOKING FLAX WAS QUENCHED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A wiser</span> than any here has said that as a man lieth
down, so riseth he up; and inasmuch as a good deed
had rounded out the Tuesday which was to be held
worthy of anniversaries, it was Brant the brother-keeper
who thrust his head into Antrim’s room on the
Wednesday morning what time the convalescent was
dressing.</p>

<p>“Peace to your ashes, Henry, my son! How do you
pan out by this time?”</p>

<p>“Better, thank you; only I’m black and blue in
spots and too sore to talk about. Say, do you know, I
think I must have been in a fight last night! But I
don’t remember the first thing about it.”</p>

<p>Brant grinned. “I had been aching to get a
chance at you, and it came in my way last night—trying
to make you come alive to your responsibilities, you
know. Never gave anybody such a jolly good beating
in all my life. Shall I come in and shake you into your
raiment?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thank you; I’ll be down directly. Wait
for me, if you are not in too much of a hurry. I’ll eat
with you.”</p>

<p>Brant waited, and after breakfast they walked down
town together. It was a tonic autumn morning, with a
crisp clean wind blowing fresh from the snow-capped
peaks, and a marvellous clarity in the atmosphere that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
seemed to bring the nearer foothills within easy speaking
distance. On such a morning it was good to be
alive, and Brant said something to that effect—an assertion
to which Antrim gave conditional assent.</p>

<p>“Yes, if a fellow’s head could be as clear and
bright as the morning and the atmosphere.”</p>

<p>“A fellow shouldn’t roil his brains with muddy
fire water, then.”</p>

<p>“No; but I didn’t mean just that. That is only a
consequence.”</p>

<p>“A very unnecessary consequence in your case.
You know you haven’t a peg of an excuse to hang
your villainy on, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I haven’t, when you get down to the
marrow of the thing. A man never has a water-tight
excuse for making several kinds of a donkey of himself.
But I’d like to be allowed to say that it was the worst
facer I have ever had. You see, I had been banking
on a certain kind of happiness ever since Isabel and I
used to go to school together; and then to have to give
it up—well, it just knocked me out, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“But you are not going to stay knocked out, and
you are not going to give it up—unless you are a
donkey sober as well as a donkey drunk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I’ve had my little fling, and I paid the
piper’s bill last night. That settles the bottle imp.
But as to the other, you don’t know Isabel.”</p>

<p>“Of course; no one but your own sapient self
could know her. How long is it since you have seen
her?”</p>

<p>“A week.”</p>

<p>“No longer than that? Suffering humanity! You
didn’t lose any time on the way down, did you? Are
you far enough out to transplant a few little cuttings of
advice?”</p>

<p>Antrim nodded, and then qualified the nod. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
guess so; anyway, you have earned the right to tell me
what I ought to do.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bueno</i>; and this is what you are to do: Go over
to Hollywood this evening, just as if nothing had happened.
Keep your wits about you, and see if Isabel
isn’t quite as glad to see you as you are to see her.”</p>

<p>But Antrim’s mood was not optimistic. “I know;
that is the way it looks to you. But, you see, I have
known her all her life, and——”</p>

<p>“And therefore you think you know it all. But
you don’t. I have seen a good bit of the Langfords in
the last few weeks, and if you haven’t a mortgage on the
future of the younger daughter, no one else has.”</p>

<p>Now it is one of the peculiarities of jealousy that it
will come alive again and again long after there is reason
to believe that it has been effectually killed. Antrim
stole a swift side glance at his mentor, and there
was a fine-lined frown between his level brows.</p>

<p>“I wish I were as sure of that as you seem to be.”</p>

<p>Brant looked up quickly. “Now, what fresh idiocy
is this? You know well enough that however little
she may seem to care for you, she doesn’t care anything
for any one else.”</p>

<p>“Do I?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t, you are a greater donkey than I
thought you were.”</p>

<p>“Well, let that pass. But if another man hasn’t
the inside track, art has.”</p>

<p>“Oh, art be hanged! Once in a thousand years or
so you may find a girl who is an artist first and a woman
afterward, but you haven’t run up against the exception.
If you will bear with me, I’ll dare say that Isabel
is the merest <i>dilettante</i>; she can’t paint a little bit.”</p>

<p>“She can’t, eh? That is all you know about it!”
Antrim retorted hotly. “What the dickens do you
know about art, anyway?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Brant chuckled joyously. “Nothing, my son—less
than nothing. I did but skewer you to see if you were
really jealous of Miss Isabel’s poor little passion. Go
in and win, Harry, my boy; and may your house be
decorated in many colours, as it is pretty sure to be.”</p>

<p>In such heartening manner began a day fraught
with many happenings. Brant completed the map in
good time for the purposes of the general manager,
and it was scarcely off the drawing-board when Colonel
Bowran returned, summoned by wire to meet the other
officials of the railway company. And since the colonel
brought the Grotter notebook with plentiful data for
more map work, the chance of enforced idleness, which
Brant dreaded more than anything else, was pushed
forward into an indefinite future.</p>

<p>Moreover, the chief was well pleased with the work
done on the yard map, and was gratified to be assured
that he had at last found an office man who could go
ahead on his own responsibility. So there was hearty
approval and commendation for the draughtsman; and
what with this, and the blessings which belong rightfully
to those of the helping hand, Brant won through
the day on the crest of the wave.</p>

<p>But the purely personal point of view, pitched as it
may be upon any hilltop of present satisfaction, is
necessarily restricted; and beyond the ken of the satisfied
one other things were happening which were to
bear heavily upon his future.</p>

<p>For one, the train speeding down the cañon on the
day run from the region of mining camps was bringing
Hobart and his wife to Denver. For another, Antrim’s
purposed visit to Hollywood was postponed by
order of the general manager. The party in the private
car Aberystwyth was to go out on a tour of inspection,
and, in the absence of his superior, Antrim
was required to do the honours of the Western Division.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Again, late in the afternoon Mrs. Langford wrote a
letter which she put into the post office with her own
hands. This was the third happening, and the fourth
was still more portentous. At the moment when Mrs.
Langford was mailing her letter, two men met behind a
locked door in a West Denver lodging house to lay the
train of a mine in which the explosives were already
stored.</p>

<p>In this conference behind the locked door there was
a slight disagreement arising in a very natural reluctance
on the part of one of the plotters to play the cat’s-paw
for the other.</p>

<p>“Coming right down to brass tacks, Jim Harding, I
don’t see why I want to monkey with your end of the
game, anyhow,” said the cat’s-paw. “All I need is to
get even with him for knocking me out, and I can do
that the first time I get the drop on him, ’thout mixin’
up any in your deal.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you can get yourself choked with a rope
for doing it,” added Harding. “Now, on the other
hand, if my scheme works—and it will work if you will
do your part—the sheriff will do the evening-up business
for you, and you can sit back and read all about
it in the newspapers the next morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ‘if’; but that there ‘if’ is bigger than
Pike’s Peak. You seem to think if you can get hold
o’ them dockyments he’s got, you can change a few
words in ’em and make out that Plucky George is the
man they want—chuck him plumb into your shoes.
Maybe you can; but there’s a heap o’ holes in a skimmer.
Seems like you’ve lived long enough to know
that.”</p>

<p>“That is all right; I know what I am doing,” was
the confident assertion. “As it stands now, it is between
me and Brant. It was an all-around free fight,
and he was mixed up in it, too. Once let me get hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
of those papers, and he will have his hands full to
prove that <i>he</i> didn’t kill Hank Brinton.”</p>

<p>“I don’t savez it that way; but that part of it is
your funeral—not mine. What is it you want me to
do? Measure it off.”</p>

<p>“You know; I want you to get the papers.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you do it yourself?”</p>

<p>“It’s out of my line. I don’t happen to have been
over the road for house-breaking—as you have—and I
am not up in that branch of the business.”</p>

<p>Gasset scowled and gritted out an oath at this, but
finally asked, “Well—when?”</p>

<p>“The quicker, the sooner; the first night we can
be sure he isn’t in his room.”</p>

<p>“Reckon he keeps the papers in his room?”</p>

<p>“Surely. Where else would they be?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But it appears like if it was me, I’d
lock ’em up somewheres where they’d be safe.”</p>

<p>“He might, if he thought anybody was trying to lift
them. But he doesn’t suspect anything of the kind.
He doesn’t even know I’m in Denver.”</p>

<p>“All right; it’s a go. I’ll swipe the papers for you
if I can find ’em, and after that you fork over, and we’re
quits. I tell you right now, though, I’d a heap rather
play it alone.”</p>

<p>“Do what you please after you get the papers.
When you hand them over to me, it’s a cool hundred in
your clothes. After that, if you would rather take the
chance of dancing on nothing instead of letting him
do it, why, go ahead. You may kill him and welcome,
so far as I am concerned.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; you’re all right. You’ve got everything
to gain, and nothing much to lose, as near as I can
make out. But let her go. Better try it to-night?”</p>

<p>“One time is as good as another, if he will stay out
late enough to give you a chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“Enough said. Let’s go and have a drink on it.”</p>

<p>“Not too many drinks, Ike, if you want to earn
your money. Keep your head clear till this job is
done, and then you can fill your skin to the queen’s
taste, if you feel like it.”</p>

<p>They went out together, and Harding locked the
door. In a neighbouring barroom, while they were
drinking to the success of the plot, the cat’s-paw asked
one other question:</p>

<p>“How are we going to find out if the coast’s clear?
Had you thought o’ that?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we’ll shadow him from the time he leaves
his office and see where he goes,” was the reply. “And
it is about time to begin that right now. Come on.”</p>

<p>Thus the varying lines of events converged upon
the unsuspecting one, who a little later cleaned his pens
and put away his drawing instruments in deference to
the failing daylight. It had been a comfortable day,
and, contrary to his habit, which was abstemious even
on the tobacco side, he lighted a cigar to smoke on
the way up to supper. While he was putting on his
coat a footstep echoed in the empty corridor. It was
the postman making his final round. The letter slide
in the door clicked, and a square envelope fell to the
floor. Brant picked it up, read his own name in the
superscription, and went to the window to save the
trouble of lighting the gas.</p>

<p>The daylight was nearly gone, but there was enough
of it to enable him to pick out his correspondent’s message
from the tangle of fashionable angles and heavy
downstrokes. Also there was light enough to show
forth the change from disinterest to astoundment, and
from astoundment to dull rage and desperation that
crept into his face as he read.</p>

<p>“In view of his clandestine meeting with Miss
Langford yesterday,” said the writer, “Mr. Brant will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
not be unprepared for such interference as Miss Langford’s
natural guardian is constrained to make. Up to
the present time the writer of this has refrained from
discussing, even in the family circle, a subject which is
as repugnant to her as it must prove humiliating to Mr.
Brant; but if Mr. Brant does not find it convenient to
relieve her of further disquietude in the matter by
leaving Denver at once, it will become her unpleasant
duty to take her daughters into her confidence—a duty
which she sincerely hopes Mr. Brant will not make obligatory.”</p>

<p>There was no signature, and none was needed.
Brant read the letter through twice, and then tore it
slowly into tiny fragments, opening the window to
brush the bits of paper out into the twilight, and watching
them as they disappeared like circling snowflakes.
Suddenly his clenched hands went up and he swore a
mighty oath, and in that oath was a recantation of all
the good resolves which had been writing themselves
down throughout the day of comfort.</p>

<p>The outburst of cursings seemed to steady him, as
the earthquake subsides when the volcano finds vent.
He closed the window carefully and fastened it, and
then went to spread the dust-cloth over his work on the
drawing-board, folding it smoothly down at the corners,
as one might drape the pall over the corpse of a thing
dead. Some thought of the simile must have suggested
itself, since he broke out in bitter speech:</p>

<p>“That is precisely what I am doing; it is a pall,
and it covers the corpse of my little nursling of decency.
God help me! Two hours ago—two minutes
ago, I thought I had a chance for my life; and now it is
all done and over with, and I am banished like an unclean
thing. I’ll go. She knew I’d go when she
thonged that whip for me. I’ll go to my own place.”</p>

<p>Thereupon one may conceive that all the good in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
him would rise up and plead strenuously for a little
respite, for a few hours of sober second thought in
which the soul-destroying possibilities of such a relapse
might be weighed and measured; but to such a plea
such a man must needs harden his heart and drive out
the better prompting with muttered curses, as thus:
“No, by God! I have listened to that song for the last
time! From now on there is nothing to do but to forget,
if I can. And I shall forget, I will forget, if I have
to smother myself in the reek of the bottomless pit to
do it!”</p>

<p>As he passed the colonel’s desk on his way to the
door his hand sought the train mail box mechanically
and from force of habit. There were two letters in the
box, letters written by the chief engineer before going
out with the party in the private car, and Brant slipped
them into his pocket, excusing himself to himself for
letting the bit of routine obtrude itself into the presence
chamber of desperate resolves. “I’ll take them
down and put them on the train. It is my last day of
honest work, and I’ll round it out fairly.”</p>

<p>The masthead electric lamps over the platform at
the Union Depot lighted the customary train-time pandemonium
when he passed through the archway and
made one in the jostling crowd under the arc lamps.
It was before the day of gates and gate keepers, and
the unquiet throng filled the open space opposite the
archway. From the open space as a fountain head
little rivulets of humanity filtered away to trickle
up and down between the trains headed in either direction.</p>

<p>A symphony of sound, pitched in the key of preparation,
rose upon the still air of the outer night. The
hum of human voices; the rumblings of the baggage
trucks piled mountain-high with outgoing luggage; the
monotonous “Look out!” of the baggagemen as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
steered the rumbling mountains slowly through the
throng; the measured beat of the air-brake pumps on
the waiting engines, drowned at irregular intervals by a
cacophonous blast from some overloaded safety valve—these
contributed to a din which was rather harmonious
than discordant.</p>

<p>But if the savage scowl of him told the truth, Brant
was in no mood to find harmony in anything—to find it
or to contribute to it. Having mailed the two letters
in the baggage car, he pushed his way aggressively
through the narrow space between the trains, intent
only upon getting free of the crowd. At the steps of
the Pullman he jostled one man so rudely that the victim
turned in pardonable heat. It was Hobart; and
when he recognised the offender resentment gave place
to gladness.</p>

<p>“Why, George! By all that’s good, this is lucky!
I had given up all hope of seeing you on this trip.”</p>

<p>Brant shook hands as if it were a thing which could
not be avoided, and his greeting was anything but cordial.
“How are you?” he said; and then, reverting to
the hope, “I guess it wasn’t very hard to give up; I
haven’t been hard to find.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but I managed to miss you all
around; drove first to your boarding house, and have
just come down from your office. I have been in town
only an hour and a half, all told, and a good bit of that
was used up in taking Kate over to Judge Langford’s.
But never mind about that; luck is with us for a minute
or two. How are you getting along? and why
don’t you write once in a while?”</p>

<p>Brant ignored the friendly questions, and went back
of them to the statement of fact.</p>

<p>“Do you know the Langfords?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes; didn’t I tell you? I meant to send
you a note of introduction to them. The judge is one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
of the stockholders in our mine—the vice-president, in
fact.”</p>

<p>“And you say Mrs. Hobart is at Hollywood?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I brought her down on a visit. Too much
altitude for her on Jack Mountain. But tell me about
yourself. How has the world been using you?”</p>

<p>“As well as I deserve, I suppose,” answered Brant
shortly—so shortly that Hobart knew not what to make
of it. Then the conductor’s cry of “All aboard!”
warned him that he had but a moment more, and he
took a card from his case and scribbled a line on the
back of it.</p>

<p>“Take this and call upon them—only you won’t
need it if you will make yourself known to Kate. Sixteen,
Altamont Terrace, is the number; but if you
know Hollywood, you know the place. They are good
people to know, and Kate will put you on an old
friend’s footing from the start.” Hobart tossed his
handbag up to the porter and turned back for a last
word. “Now don’t put it off; go soon—this evening,
if you have time.” And seeing that Brant stood as
one indeterminate, he bent to whisper: “Kate knows
nothing but good of you, if that makes any difference.”</p>

<p>Now in the face of all this kindly interest none but
a churl could withhold the decent meed of gratitude.
Brant did not withhold it, but if the light had been better
Hobart must have seen that the thanks were little
more than perfunctory—or, at least, less than hearty.
Then the wheels began to turn, and there was time only
for a hasty leave-taking; this also without heartiness
on the part of the one who was not going. He stood
scowling after the receding train until the two red eyes
of the tail lights disappeared around a curve; then he
turned and walked slowly uptown, with his hands deep
in his overcoat pockets and his eyes on the sidewalk.
There was little comfort to be got out of the late incident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
on the station platform. To be sure, it proved
that Hobart was still stanch, and that he had not received
the letter which was a cry for help. But Mrs.
Hobart’s presence at Hollywood could only complicate
matters.</p>

<p>What was in Brant’s mind as he tramped up the
street was not readable in the face of him, but just before
he turned out of the shop-lined thoroughfare he
strode into a drug store and called for a pint of
brandy. He had the bottle in his pocket when he
reached his room, and when he had locked the door he
stripped off his coat, found a glass, and poured himself
a drink vast enough to drown a very amphibian trouble.
At the moment of pouring the gas burned blue and
sank to a pin point, as poor gas will, and the sheen from
the arc light in the street set the liquor afire in the
glass. The illusion was strong enough to draw him to
the window, where he stood holding the glass to the
light and watching the play of the electric beam in the
brown liquid. In the act the gas burned brightly again,
and two men who had been watching the house from
the opposite sidewalk darted into the blue-black shadows
of the curbstone cottonwoods.</p>

<p>Brant put the liquor down untasted, and waited
long and patiently for the two figures to reappear beyond
the cottonwoods. When it became apparent that
the blue-black shadows were still concealing them, he
turned out the gas and went back to the window to
look again. This time his patience was rewarded by a
glimpse of the two men; and when he had made sure of
their identity, he drew up a chair and sat at the window
to await further developments, with the big revolver
laid across his knees.</p>

<p>And it was thus, sitting in his shirt sleeves, with his
hand on the big revolver, that the morning sun shining
broadly in at the casement found and aroused him;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
aroused him with a start for which there was no apparent
call, since the room and its belongings were undisturbed,
even to the uncorked brandy bottle on the
dressing case, and the untasted half glassful on the
window seat.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the man that when he came
out of his bath a half hour later, breathing the fragrance
of cleanliness, he should pour the untasted
drink back into the bottle, corking it therein against a
time not of greater need, but of less responsibility.
For he remembered that Colonel Bowran was again out
of town, and until his chief returned he could by no
means have his quittance from the claims of duty—or
of decency.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>HOW DOROTHY BLEW THE EMBERS ALIVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> railway inspection party of which the chief
engineer was a member did not return to Denver until
late in the afternoon, and by consequence Brant wore
out the day like a caged wild beast, tramping miles on
end up and down the long apartment which served as a
workroom in the chief engineer’s suite. Not once
during the lagging hours did he uncover the drawing-board;
but on the other hand, if he did not work,
neither did he put himself in the way of temptation,
spirituous or other. It was as if he had promised himself
that he would quit clean-handed and clear-headed;
that, until the colonel should release him, he would remain,
as nearly as might be, the man whom the colonel
had befriended.</p>

<p>The day was drawing to its close when the burly little
man who was partial to college graduates bustled in
and struggled out of his greatcoat. Brant assaulted
promptly, saying what had to be said in terms of the
simplest. He had made up his mind to leave Denver
at once, and he would be glad if the colonel would give
him his quittance and let him go.</p>

<p>The struggle with the greatcoat paused in the midst,
and the burly one, who knew a capable man when he
found him, protested vigorously:</p>

<p>“What’s that? Leave me just when I am beginning
to know what a comfort it is to have you about?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
What’s gone wrong with you? Is it too much work, or
not enough pay?”</p>

<p>“It is neither; it is nothing that you have done,
or failed to do, my dear colonel. On the contrary, your
kindness will be one of the things that I shall always be
glad to remember. But I have never been able to stay
long in any one place, and the time has come for me
to move on.”</p>

<p>“But surely, my dear boy, you haven’t taken time
to think about it! Why, it was only yesterday that
you seemed perfectly contented.”</p>

<p>“I know; but I have been thinking about it for a
week or more. I am afraid I can’t reconsider.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I’m sorry; only that doesn’t half express
it. I hope you haven’t to go right away. You
can stay on a few days till I can look around a bit,
can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to have to say that I can’t do even
that,” Brant began, and just here the entrance of the
postman interrupted the colloquy. There were letters—several
for the colonel and one for the draughtsman.
Brant opened and read his, while the chief engineer
hastily glanced through the others. Brant’s was a
dainty note, and it appeared to move him strangely.
His cheek flushed under the bronze, and his eyes kindled
as he read; and when the talk was presently renewed
he promptly stultified himself.</p>

<p>“You were asking if I could stay on until you had
found some one else,” he said. “On second thought, I
don’t know but I can, if it will be an accommodation
to you.”</p>

<p>The colonel was too well pleased with the sudden
change of front to show his surprise, though he could
not help putting two and two together and wondering
who was the writer of the dainty note which had evidently
countermanded Brant’s marching orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Of course it will be an accommodation,” he hastened
to say. “I shall have to go back to the Extension
to-night to figure on Hurlcrow’s estimates for next
month, but I’ll come in as soon as I can, and then, if
you are of the same mind, I’ll look around for some
one to relieve you. But I hope you will find it possible
to reconsider. I like you, and your work is as thorough
and accurate as I knew it would be when you told
me you were coached by my old friend Thirlwill.”</p>

<p>Brant did not commit himself, and the colonel
tossed the lately opened letters into his desk and drew
down the roll-top. “I shall be with the general manager
and the president in the Aberystwyth till train
time, and to-morrow you can reach me at the front,”
he went on. “Take things a bit easy while I am gone,
and see if you can’t make up your mind to stay with
us.”</p>

<p>Being just then devoured with an impatience in
comparison with which the restlessness of the long day
was but a sedative, Brant did not seek to prolong the
interview; and when he was once more alone he read
and reread his letter until he could repeat it word for
word. It was from Dorothy; and she had kept her
promise to call upon him in the time of need. She
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Brant</span>: You were kind enough to
offer to help us again if the occasion should arise. It
<i>has</i> arisen. Will left home yesterday afternoon, and we
have not seen him since. Mamma is wild with anxiety,
and my father is so greatly discouraged that he will do
nothing. Won’t you please try to find my brother again?</p>

<p>“P.S. Mrs. Hobart, whose husband is a friend of
yours, is with us, and she will be glad to see you when
you find it convenient to come.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>When he had quite committed the note to memory
Brant set about answering it. Whatever else he was or
might become—and under the sentence of ostracism
this question seemed settled beyond peradventure of
doubt—he was none the less Dorothy’s loyal liegeman,
and while he could serve her, the future, good, bad, or
indifferent, might wait for its due. Therefore, after a
half dozen false starts, he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Langford</span>:</p>

<p>“Your note, which makes me both sorry and glad,
has just found me. Be assured that, while I grieve with
you in your present trouble, I am only too happy to
place myself at your service. Be of good cheer. I trust
we shall speedily find your brother, and that nothing
serious has befallen him. If he should not come home
to-night, send me a line in the morning; and believe
me, now as always,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your sincere friend,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">George Brant</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>He read it over when it was written, and made as if
he would tear it up. Certainly it was anything but
loverlike in its measured coolness and conventional
formality. He laid it aside and tried again:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">My Loved One</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>“May I write as I should if Mr. Crosswell had not
come in upon us the day before yesterday? If I may—if
your own heart says I may—I shall not need to tell
you how glad your note makes me; what a joy it is to
have you turn to me in any time of need. Be very sure,
my dear one, that I shall run to do your bidding.
There will be difficulties in the way this time—difficulties
which did not exist before. An old enemy of mine
has prejudiced your brother against me. But if the
obstacles were ten times as many I should overcome
them for your dear sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“Your note found me when I was in the depths of
despair, and while it has comforted me by giving me
something to do for you, the future is still very dark,
and I know not what it holds for me. But this I do
know: that if your love may shine for me as a light in
great darkness, I shall have strength to keep from turning
back; nay, courage and strength to go forward, if
only you will stand at the end of the snare-beset way
and beckon me.</p>

<p>“Let me have a line from you again in the morning
if William has not returned.</p>

<p class="right">“Faithfully and lovingly——”</p>
</div>

<p>He paused at the signature, and read and reread the
two replies. And, after all, it was the formal note that
a district messenger was presently bearing awheel to
the transplanted Southern mansion in the Highlands,
and the love letter lay torn into tiny fragments in Colonel
Bowran’s wastebasket.</p>

<p>The answer to Dorothy’s note despatched, Brant
began to cast about for ways and means to the end she
besought. As he had intimated in the letter which was
not sent, there were difficulties. Harding had doubtless
sown the seed of prejudice and ill will, harrowing
it well in; in which case young Langford, when found,
would have nothing to do with the man against whom
he had been warned. Brant gave the difficulty a
thoughtful half hour, at the end of which he sought
Antrim. The chief clerk was just closing his office
to go to supper, and he was glad enough to have company.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with yourself to-night,
Harry?” Brant asked, when they were free of the
downtown six-o’clock sidewalk throngs.</p>

<p>“I am just in from the inspection trip, and I meant
to go back to the office and work a while. Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“I want you to do something for me, if you will.”</p>

<p>“After what you did for me last night, you have
only to ask,” was the grateful rejoinder. “State your
case.”</p>

<p>Brant stated it at some length, omitting none of the
details save those which might have defined his own
motive in playing the knight-errant.</p>

<p>“I think I know where to look for the boy,” he said
in conclusion; “but I am more than afraid that any
argument that I could bring to bear on him would be
so much wasted eloquence. I want you to go along,
and when we find him it will be your part of the job
to persuade him to go home.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t much use for me, as I have told you,”
Antrim objected. “But I’ll go along and do what I
can. It’s a great pity the judge doesn’t set him to work
at something.”</p>

<p>“What is his bent? or has he any?” asked Brant.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that he has any now. At school
he was the best mathematician in his class; and there
was a time when he wanted to learn your trade. Mrs.
Langford was quite willing until it came to field work,
and then she put her foot down. Her Willie was not
to go careering around all over the world with a lot of
rough engineers, she said.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; of course not,” assented Brant, not without
scorn. “She was quite right; we are a hard
lot.”</p>

<p>The emphasis was so bitter that Antrim glanced up
in surprise. “Has she been giving you a lecture on the
subject?” he asked quizzically.</p>

<p>“Who—Mrs. Langford? Certainly not,” denied
Brant, hedging promptly. “She has never mentioned
my present occupation to me.”</p>

<p>“She will, some day; especially if—” But Antrim
was not sure of his ground in the matter of Brant’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
leanings, and he broke off abruptly to go back to the
former question. “I suppose you will want to start out
right after supper?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Brant, and they went into the house
and entered Mrs. Seeley’s dining room together.</p>

<p>After the meal, which was hurried in deference to
the urgencies, Brant went up to his room to prepare for
the quest. While there he appeared to be drawn into a
struggle which, in view of all the wicked things he had
sworn to do, was scarcely less than trivial. It manifested
itself in sundry takings up and layings down of
the big revolver, ending when he finally put the weapon,
together with the unbroached bottle of brandy, into the
drawer of his dressing case.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll be hanged if I do!” he muttered. “I’ll
not go armed like a desperado on any errand of hers.
If I find the boy with Harding, there will probably be a
row; but while I am about her business I’d rather suffer
violence than do it.” Whereupon he ran down to Antrim,
and together they set out on the quest for William
Langford.</p>

<p>Contrary to his expressed assumption, the first half
of the undertaking proved more difficult than Brant
had expected. Beginning with resorts of the Draco
type, they went from bad to worse, working their way
downward through the substrata of vice until Antrim
held his breath and hoped for William’s younger sister’s
sake that the search would be unsuccessful in that direction.
And so, indeed, it proved to be, though Brant
was indefatigable, dragging his companion from dive
to den as he had once dragged Forsyth, until the chief
clerk was half intoxicated with the mingled fumes of
tobacco and opium and alcohol—half intoxicated and
wholly disgusted.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! and this is what I was coming to!”
he gasped, as they emerged from a particularly noisome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
kennel. “Let’s give it up, old man, and go home.
I’m sick and nauseated.”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” Brant objected. “We are sure to find
him, sooner or later; and it is early yet.”</p>

<p>Antrim looked at his watch. “Eleven o’clock. I
call that late. But go on; I’ll stay with you.”</p>

<p>Eleven it was, and the policeman, whose beat included
the quiet neighbourhood of which Mrs. Anna
Seeley’s select boarding house for young men was the
centre, had finished his round and had dropped into
the nearest uptown saloon for a bite of bread and
cheese and such other refreshment as the bartender
was wont to set unasked before the guardians of the
city’s peace.</p>

<p>“You have a picnic on the uptown beat, don’t you,
Sam?” said the licensed dispenser of stimulants, drawing
a second glass of beer for the officer.</p>

<p>“Pretty near that. Might jog around up here all
night and never see nothing out of the way,” responded
the civic soldier, helping himself to another sandwich.
This he said, and yet, not ten minutes before, he had
met a man carrying a ladder in a quiet street within
an hour of midnight, and had not thought the matter
curious enough to warrant looking into.</p>

<p>But if the officer had been unmoved, the man with
the ladder had not. On the contrary, he was greatly
disturbed, and was deterred from casting down his burden
and taking to his heels only by the fear that a
bullet from the civic soldier’s pistol might outrun him.
When the danger was overpast, he rested the ladder
against the fence and took a long pull from a flat
pocket bottle.</p>

<p>“Whooh!” he growled, stopping to take breath,
and glancing up at the darkened windows of the Seeley
house. “I’ll just about get my blooming leg pulled
for twenty years before I get through with this deal!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Run right smack against that cop, when I’d been dodging
him for a half hour and better!”</p>

<p>The flat bottle gurgled again, and then the ladder
was lifted and dropped quietly over the fence, to be
reared presently behind a tangle of evergreen vines at
the end of the veranda. A minute later the man appeared
at the top and made his way cautiously over
the tin roof, which bulged and crackled under his
weight until the sweat of fear made him damp and uncomfortable.
He paused before Brant’s window, and,
inserting a thin-edged bit of steel beneath the sash,
tried it gently.</p>

<p>“Fastened, of course,” he muttered, and a knife
blade was slipped deftly between the upper and lower
sash. There was a muffled click, and then the window
opened noiselessly. Once safely inside, the burglar’s
first care was to close the window and to draw the curtains.
Then he lighted a dark lantern and flashed its
beam around the room.</p>

<p>“So far, so good,” was his comment. “Camp
cached, and nobody at home. Now for them dockyments.”</p>

<p>He took another pull at the flat bottle as a preliminary,
and then proceeded to ransack the apartment
with the skilful rapidity of one to whom the craft was
not new. The belongings of a man’s room are soon
overhauled. Brant’s impedimenta were of the lightest,
and in a short time the burglar came to the end of his
quest without finding anything more to the purpose
than a large revolver and a bottle of brandy. Laying
the weapon aside, he unstoppered the bottle and sampled
its contents.</p>

<p>“Brandy—ten-year-old cognac, as I’m a sinner!”
He held the bottle up and flashed the beam of the
lantern on it. Then he gave a toast. “Here’s to
you, Mister Snap-shot Brant; and may you live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
happy and die suddint—when I git the drop on
you!”</p>

<p>The liquor paid the penalty of the toast at a frightful
cost, and the burglar smacked his lips and wiped
them on the sleeve of his coat.</p>

<p>“Blast him! he knows what good liquor is,” he remarked.
“I’ll say that much for him, anyway. Now,
then, I’ll have a squint among his clothes.”</p>

<p>He dived into the closet and came out with an armful
of clothing, and when the pockets yielded nothing
he broke out in a monologue of thick-tongued malediction,
and again had recourse to the brandy bottle.
After a deeper potation than any of the preceding he
did that which was afterward to prove his undoing.
He drew up Brant’s easy-chair and sat down to curse
his ill luck.</p>

<p>The process was a long one, and it was eked out by
many more tiltings of the bottle. When it was wrought
out to its conclusion the bottle was empty, but the man
was not. Some glimmerings of sanity remained, but
they pointed only to his bafflement, and not to the
necessity for escape. When he staggered to his feet it
was to determine what spoil, lacking the papers, would
best repay his hazard.</p>

<p>So he fell to rummaging again, and after much dubitation
decided to carry off the easy-chair as the thing
most greatly to be desired. Failing to get the chair
through the opened window, he compromised upon a
suit of clothes; and after trying vainly to roll them
into a portable bundle, he cut that Gordian knot by
struggling out of his own garments, kicking them into
the depths of the closet, and arraying himself in the
suit of black.</p>

<p>That done—it took so long that the china clock
on the mantel was tinkling out the midnight hour—he
put the big revolver in his pocket and sat down on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the edge of the bed to gather himself for the passage
perilous over the crackling tin roof of the veranda and
down the ladder. But in the midst of the gathering
the foolishness of those who tarry long at the wine
came upon him, and the bed transformed itself into his
bunk in the West Denver <i>Gasthaus</i>. That being the
case, there was no occasion for further efforts, perilous
or other. He tried to remember how he had got out
of the house of peril; how it was that he came to be
sitting on the edge of his bunk in safety; but in the
thick of it sleep laid its heavy hand on him, and when
the china clock on the mantel chimed the quarter past
twelve the man who had tarried too long was snoring
brazenly with his head on Brant’s pillow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>“WHOSO DIGGETH A PIT SHALL FALL THEREIN”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was between two and three o’clock in the morning
before Brant would consent, at Antrim’s solicitation,
to give over, or at least to postpone, the search for
William Langford. The midnight wanderings in the
realm of Abaddon were a wholesome corrective for the
chief clerk, whose late aberration lay heavy on his self-respect;
but, as he himself phrased it to Brant, he
knew when he had enough. One of the results of this
glimpse into the deeper depths of the pit he had so narrowly
escaped was a fresh stirring of the pool of gratitude,
and at the home-going he sought to put his debt
to Brant into fitting terms of speech. But Brant cut
him off with curt brutality:</p>

<p>“Let up on that. You don’t owe me anything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” insisted the grateful one.</p>

<p>“I say you don’t. But if you choose to think so,
you can even things up by doing your part when we
find this addle-brained boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d do that anyway, and without charging it
to your account. He is Isabel’s brother.”</p>

<p>“Yes—and Dorothy’s.” The last two words said
themselves, and it is conceivable that Brant would have
bitten his tongue before letting that unruly member
betray his secret. But Antrim’s quick apprehension
and ready sympathy were answerable.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe she was the power behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
throne,” said the chief clerk, linking his arm in that
of his companion. “You know my story, George;
won’t you tell me yours?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to tell,” said Brant shortly; and
then, after an interval in which one might cuff ill humour
into subjection: “That is to say, not anything
out of the ordinary. I think a great deal of Miss Langford—I
suppose you guessed that much long ago; but
there is nothing between us—of the sort you have in
mind, I mean. And there never will be. When I shall
have found her brother I shall go away and probably
never see her again.”</p>

<p>“Go away?” echoed Antrim. “I thought you had
given up that idea. Why are you going away?”</p>

<p>They had reached the house, and Brant turned on
the doorstep to put his hands on Antrim’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me, Harry,” he said gently. “Passing
your own words back to you, it is a thing I can’t talk
about, even to you. You will know all about it some
day, perhaps, and then you will understand—if you
don’t go over to the enemy, horse, foot, and artillery,
with the rest of them.”</p>

<p>Antrim laughed. “I’m not much on making rash
promises, and talk is pretty cheap; but when that day
comes you will have a friend who will stay with you
if you haven’t another on the face of the earth.”</p>

<p>“Don’t commit yourself blindfold,” warned Brant,
fitting his key to the nightlatch. “The chances are
that you will be ashamed to admit that you have ever
known me.”</p>

<p>They climbed the stair quietly, so as not to disturb
the house, and Antrim entered his room and closed the
door. While he was lighting the gas there was a tap
on the panel and Brant came in.</p>

<p>“Will you give me a shakedown on your lounge till
morning?” he asked. “Mrs. Seeley evidently thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
I was going to make a night of it, and she has put some
one into my room.”</p>

<p>Antrim made haste to be hospitable, but he looked
mystified.</p>

<p>“Surely. But I don’t understand that a little bit.
It isn’t at all like Mrs. Seeley.”</p>

<p>“No; it is rather odd.”</p>

<p>“I should say so. Are you sure there is somebody
there?”</p>

<p>“On the evidence of two separate senses. I struck
a match and saw a man in my bed; and besides that—listen.”
The subdued murmur of the intruder’s snoring
was quite audible, and Brant went on: “Moreover,
to add to the oddness of it, the man has been drinking.
The room reeks like a pothouse.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is queer,” mused Antrim; and then:
“Maybe it is one of the boys gone wrong and couldn’t
find his room. But in that case I can’t imagine who it
could be.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” rejoined Brant, stretching himself wearily
on the lounge. “Never mind; we’ll find out all about
it in the morning.”</p>

<p>So he said, and fell asleep; but the morning event
discredited the confident assertion. When they went
down together to a late breakfast and mentioned the
matter to Mrs. Seeley, the good lady was quite as astonished
as her lodgers had been. Moreover, she was
touched in a tender part, and her inn-keeping pride resented
the imputation put upon it by Brant’s suggestion.</p>

<p>“Put any one in your room? Why, Mr. Brant!
to think you would suspect me of doing such a thing!
Why, never in all my born days did I——”</p>

<p>A chattering shriek from the upper regions cut the
protest in half, and the three occupants of the dining
room rushed into the hall in good time to meet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
housemaid flying down, the stair, wild-eyed and incoherent.</p>

<p>“A man—a man in Misther Brant’s room!” was
all she could say, and, at the word, Brant and the chief
clerk darted up to the second floor three steps at a
bound. Arrived on the scene of the mystery, they
found an empty room smelling strongly of brandy, an
open window, and a little heap of Brant’s clothing in
the middle of the floor. Antrim made a dash for the
window, and was out upon the tin roof of the veranda
in a twinkling. When he climbed back into the room
there was the light of discovery in his eye.</p>

<p>“There is a ladder standing against the end of the
porch. That is how he got away.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and it is how he came,” said Brant. “He
was a—” He stopped abruptly and clapped his hand
upon his pocket. There was only one thing among his
belongings that any one would risk life or liberty to obtain,
and that thing was safe. He drew out the packet
of papers and gave it to the chief clerk.</p>

<p>“He was a burglar,” he said, finishing his sentence,
“and he made the mistake of taking a drop too
much.”</p>

<p>Antrim was turning the packet over and reading
the superscription: “To be opened at my death.
George Brant.” “What is this?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p>“It is what the burglar was after. Take it and
lock it up in your safe, and I’ll tell you about it later.
Now we’ll go down and get the fellow’s description
from Mary.”</p>

<p>That was easier said than done. The housemaid
was too thoroughly frightened to be successfully cross-examined.
The intruder was tall, he was short. In
one breath he wore a beard and was a very buccaneer in
general appearance; in the next, he was smooth-shaven.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Picked out and pieced together, her facts were but
two: she had seen a strange man dressed in black,
and he had rushed first at her and then toward the
window.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seeley and Antrim badgered the servant for
further data and sank deeper into the mire of wonderment
at each fresh rendering of her adventure; but
Brant stood aside as one who rides upon his own train
of thought. The burglar’s object defined, there was
only the question of identity to be answered. Harding
was a coward, and he was much too shrewd to defeat his
own end and risk his neck for the sake of a bottle of
brandy. Wherefore, Harding must have employed an
emissary. But who could he find who was at once
brave enough to take the risk and foolhardy enough to
get drunk in the midst of it? No seasoned house-breaker,
certainly; it was more like the hare-brained
prank of a reckless boy; such a boy, for instance, as
William Langford.</p>

<p>Brant bided his time, and when Mrs. Seeley went
above-stairs to view the scene of the invasion he lagged
behind with Mary McCarthy.</p>

<p>“You say he had on black clothes, Mary. Are you
sure of that?”</p>

<p>“’Deed I am that, sorr.”</p>

<p>“Did you have time to notice the kind of a coat
he wore?—how it was cut, I mean.”</p>

<p>“I did that. It was as like to the wan ye’re wearing
as two peas in a pod. On’y but I knowed ye’d gone
down to breakfast, I might have been misdeluded intirely
till I saw the oogly face av him.”</p>

<p>Inasmuch as both garments had been cut by the
same tailor from the same measurements, there was
every reason for the similarity; but Brant did not know
this, and he tallied his score and went on:</p>

<p>“At first you said he had black hair, and just now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
you told Mrs. Seeley it was brown. Take time to think
about it, and tell me which it was.”</p>

<p>“’Deed, sorr, it was both—lastewise, it was that
darrk it might be ayther wan.”</p>

<p>“Was it long, or short?”</p>

<p>“Nayther the wan nor the t’other; joosht betwixt
and betune, like.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” Brant nodded assent. The answers
came so readily, pointing step by step to the inevitable
conclusion, that they drew out a leading question:</p>

<p>“One more point now, Mary, and we have him.
Pull yourself together and try to remember his face.
He was a young fellow, wasn’t he?—smooth-faced and
rather thin, with heavy eyebrows, a straight nose, and
a mouth turned down a little at the corners?”</p>

<p>“That’s it—that’s joosht him to the parin’ av a
finger nail! ’Deed and ye might be readin’ aff from his
photygraph, Misther Brant!”</p>

<p>Brant asked no more questions. Slipping a dollar
into the housemaid’s hand, he laid a finger on his lip.
“Mum’s the word, Mary, and it will be a favour to me
if you will let the thing die out as soon as it will. I
know who it was, and it was only a bit of boy’s play,
meant to frighten me instead of you. You will help
me keep it quiet, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“’Deed and I will, then. It’s a fine gentleman ye
are, intirely, Misther Brant; and it’s never an intilligent
wurrud will they get out o’ me at all at all forninst
the b’y. But joosht to think av the impidence of the
young spalpeen!”</p>

<p>Brant thanked her and ran up to his room, where
Mrs. Seeley and Antrim were debating what should be
done. Mrs. Seeley appealed to the draughtsman.</p>

<p>“What do you think about it, Mr. Brant? I was
just asking Mr. Antrim to notify the police on his way
downtown, but he thinks we ought first to know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
has been taken. Will you look through your things
and see if anything is gone?”</p>

<p>Now, in view of the inevitable conclusion, an investigation
by the police was not to be thought of. So
Brant made his examination perfunctory, missing nothing
but the revolver and the bottle of brandy—and not
missing the suit of clothes.</p>

<p>“There is nothing gone—nothing of any consequence,”
he said. “If I were you, I shouldn’t call in
the police. If we had lost anything valuable, it would
be different; but as it is, we should gain nothing but a
lot of newspaper notoriety, and that would hurt the
house. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Seeley demurred at first. She did not quite
like the idea of having her house broken into, and then
to be denied the poor consolation of stirring up the
lazy, good-for-nothing police. But when Antrim added
his word, she yielded. On the way downtown Antrim
asked Brant a single question and no more:</p>

<p>“Tell me one thing, George. Did you give Mrs.
Seeley your real reason for wanting to keep the thing
quiet?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Brant.</p>

<p>And as he volunteered no further information, the
chief clerk dropped the subject and took up another.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will keep on hunting for Will Langford?”</p>

<p>“I shall; if he hasn’t already turned up at home.
I asked Dorothy to send me a line this morning, and if
he is still missing I shall keep on till I find him.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’m with you. Let me know what she
says, and I’ll do what I can to help. I shall be too busy
to do much through the day, but after supper I’ll be
yours to command again.”</p>

<p>Dorothy’s note came just before noon. She had
been delayed by the difficulty of finding a trustworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
messenger, she wrote. Her brother had not returned,
and the situation at home was most trying. Her
mother was sick with anxiety, and her father would
hear to nothing less harsh than the turning of the
matter over to the police. Mrs. Hobart had not been
told; and, altogether, the household was in a most
grievous state. Wouldn’t Mr. Brant send her a line
of encouragement?</p>

<p>Brant would, and did; sat down at once to indite it,
ringing first for a messenger, so that no time should
be lost.</p>

<p>“I was not able to find William last night,” he
wrote, “but I have every reason to believe that he is
alive and well; indeed, I may say that I have had speech
with a person who saw him as recently as nine o’clock
this morning. From this person, and from some circumstances
connected with her sight of him, I have obtained
a clew to his whereabouts—no, not quite that,
either; but I know what he is doing and what company
he is keeping. Owing to the peculiar nature of the affair,
this clew can not be followed up until to-night;
but again I say, be of good cheer, and by all means dissuade
your father from calling in the police. This
would merely complicate matters, and it would doubtless
prove disastrous to any hopeful future for your
brother.”</p>

<p>After this note was signed, sealed, and despatched,
Brant drowned the remainder of the day in hard work
over the drawing-board. It was the best antidote for
impatience, and, since his task chanced to be more or
less mechanical, he was able to lay his plans for the
evening as he wrought. Following out the theory verified
by Mary McCarthy’s answers, the mystery of William
Langford’s disappearance was easily accounted for.
Harding had doubtless broken his parole and returned
to Denver. He had managed in some way to get hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
of young Langford, and, with the help of the bottle
imp, to turn the boy into a house-breaker.</p>

<p>Just how the cautious fugitive from justice could
bring himself to trust the lad with the information
necessary to an intelligent search for the papers was
unexplainable. But that it had been done was beyond
question.</p>

<p>One small fact, and one only, refused to fit into the
chain of circumstantial evidence. It was this—and to
one unfamiliar with the progressive stages of the liquor
disease it might have appeared trivial: Brant had
found the empty brandy bottle on the floor of his room,
and it seemed incredible that a mere boy in the beginnings
of the case-hardening process could drink so
deeply in a single night and still be able to run away in
the morning. But stubborn as this fact was, Brant
would not allow it to upset his theory. It was William
Langford who had broken into his room; and it was
James Harding who had planned and instigated the
raid. Therefore, when Harding should be found, the
search for the boy would be successful.</p>

<p>With these premisings Brant renewed the quest in
the evening methodically. He took Antrim into his
confidence, but only so far as to hint that Will would
be found in the company of a man whose description
was thus and thus; and the chief clerk’s part in the
search was to make the round of the hotels and lodging
houses.</p>

<p>Reserving the more dangerous share for himself,
Brant went first to Draco’s; and when Deverney assured
him that nothing had been seen of Harding since
the night of his banishment, he set the peg of conclusion
one hole farther along. In his dealings with
young Langford, Harding would be likely to keep up
the fiction of respectability; hence there would be no
frequenting of the more public resorts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>Acting upon this suggestion, Brant began a round of
the more exclusive “clubhouses,” making guarded inquiries
of doorkeepers, and using his reputation with
the craft unsparingly as a pass-key to unlock doors
which would have been so many dead walls to a detective
or a policeman. Since this was a slow process, it
was well upon midnight when he ran his quarry to
earth. It was in a club called the “Osirian,” a very
palace of the goddess of Chance. The doorkeeper was
known to Brant, and under question he was able to
answer in the affirmative. Two men tallying accurately
with Brant’s description had come in early in the
evening. They were still upstairs in one of the private
rooms, the man thought; which room the attendant in
the upper corridor could doubtless point out.</p>

<p>Brant went up, and at the stairhead found himself
in a large apartment richly furnished, with a high
wainscot of polished mahogany and walls and ceilings
of bronze pacrusta wrought into curious designs centring
in clusters of softly shaded incandescent lamps.
The central space, which served as a vestibule for a
series of ceilingless private rooms built out from the
walls, was fitted as a club parlour, and Brant made his
way noiselessly over the thick carpet to the room whose
number he had obtained from the attendant at the
stairhead. The door was closed, but since the walls of
the private room were merely an extension of the high
wainscoting, there was no obstruction to sound. Beyond
the door there was a clicking as of ivory counters,
and the swish of cards across a table. Brant laid his
hand on the doorknob, and at that moment the noises
ceased and a boyish oath dropped into the gap of silence.</p>

<p>“I won’t pay it—that’s all there is about it!”—this
in the voice of the boyish oath. “By gad, I’m
tough enough, Mr. Harding, and I don’t like him any
better than you do; but I’m not a sneak thief yet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“I don’t see but you will have to pay it, Willie; it
is a debt of honour, you see,” the gambler insisted.
“You put up your promise for a stake in the game, and
you have lost, fair and square. It won’t be much
trouble—knowing him as well as you do.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand; or rather you won’t
understand. I can’t do a thing like that, tough as I
am, and nobody but a cursed cad like you would try to
make me. And, by gad, I believe you cheated me, anyway!
Let me see those cards.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I cheated you, did I? And you are going to
kick out, are you? You’re a nice, innocent kid, you are!
Now, see here: you have gone too far, a good deal too
far, to back down; and, by God, you know too much!
You are going to do just what you promised to do before
we played this game, or I’ll give you dead away for
what you did last night.—No, you don’t!—just keep
your hands on the table right where they are! I’ve got
the drop on you.”</p>

<p>Silence for a leaden-winged half minute, and then
Harding spoke again. “Are you going to do it, or
not?”</p>

<p>The boy’s voice was hoarse with passion. “I sha’n’t
say anything as long as you hold that gun on me! Put
it down, if you want me to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Brant’s big jaw was set like a mastiff’s. The knob
turned silently under his hand and the door swung
noiselessly inward. The card room, with its red-brown
walls of polished mahogany, was lighted by a single incandescent
globe bracketted from the wainscoting at
the right of the doorway. A square table stood in the
midst. On the farther side of it sat the gambler, glaring
up at the intruder, with mingled terror and ferocity
yellowing his lean face and burning in his evil eyes,
and with his right hand creeping by hairs’ breadths toward
the revolver lying upon the table. The boy was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
on the nearer side of the table; he was half out of his
chair, poising catlike for a spring, and at the instant
of Brant’s entrance he pounced upon the weapon.</p>

<p>Like a stone from a catapult Brant was upon them,
smashing the globe of the bracket light in passing, and
while one might draw a quick breath three pairs of
hands clutched fiercely in the darkness for the weapon
on the table. In the midst of the struggle—if that
which has no duration in time can be said to have a
middle part—came the crash of a pistol shot. There
was a moment of ringing silence and darkness, broken
by the clatter of a heavy weapon on the floor and a sudden
burst of light from a suspended chandelier. Then,
as if the light-burst had been a trumpet call to summon
them, the attendants and <i>habitués</i> of the place rallied
quickly, filling the small room to overflowing.</p>

<p>The first comers found Harding sitting bolt upright
in his chair, with a clean-cut hole in his temple from
which the blood was trickling in a thin stream. The
boy was shrinking opposite, with his face averted and
his hands held out before him as if to ward off a blow.
Brant was leaning against the wainscoting near the
broken lamp bracket, his arms folded and his gaze fixed
upon the upturned face of the dead man.</p>

<p>That was all, save that on the floor at Brant’s
feet lay the big revolver with an empty shell in one
chamber.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>“SILENCE IS AN ANSWER TO A WISE MAN”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the rumour of the tragedy ran through the
clubhouse the small card room on the second floor
filled quickly with a curious throng. Some made haste
to ease the limp body of the slain to the floor, and
others examined the pistol and tried to dig the bullet
out of the wainscot. A brother craftsman knelt to
unlace the victim’s shoes, but he desisted at a word
from one who had thrust his hand into the dead man’s
bosom.</p>

<p>“No use doing that now; he’s dead,” said the objector;
and at the announcement William Langford
sank back into his chair and covered his face with his
hands. Whereat the witnesses exchanged significant
glances.</p>

<p>“He’s only a boy,” said one under his breath, and
there was a touch of commiseration and rough pity in
the comment that ran quickly from one to another of
those who heard.</p>

<p>Jarvis, busy with pencil and notebook, was among
the earliest comers, writing at top speed and asking
questions which no one could answer. But the lack of
answers was no bar to a very succinct and complete
story of the tragedy which grew under the flying pencil.</p>

<p>As his chief had said of him, Jarvis was a reporter
first and everything else afterward, and the diploma of
that degree is given to the man who can make the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
of the visible facts. This is why every good reporter is
more than half a detective; and Jarvis saw and noted
some things which escaped the more morbid and less
investigative curiosity of the others.</p>

<p>Brant stood aside, seeing and hearing, it is to be
presumed, but only with the outward eye and ear, if his
face were any index. To those who saw him when the
light first leaped into the big chandelier overhead, his
face was the face of one dazed; but later the shrewd
eyes narrowed and the rapture of those who can isolate
themselves and think to the mark in any crisis wrote itself
in the square-set jaw and compressed lips and far-seeing
gaze. What turmoil of soul these crucial minutes
measured none knew and none could know, least
of all those whom the balder facts of the horror held
spellbound; and so it came about that Brant was ignored
until he pushed his way through the throng to
bend over the boy. What he said was whispered, and it
went no farther than to the ear for which it was intended.</p>

<p>“Brace yourself quickly, and don’t let them rattle
you,” he commanded. “The police will be here in a
minute, and you must deny it and stick to it through
thick and thin. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>The boy looked up, and blankness was in his face.
“Tell them I didn’t kill him?” he began vaguely;
and Brant had no more than time to nod before two
officers pushed through the throng and laid hands on
the cowering figure in the chair. The boy started to
his feet in a sudden panic of awakening, protesting
his innocence with such passionate vehemence that
Brant’s warning seemed to have been quite unnecessary,
and those who looked on wondered at the boy’s
hardihood.</p>

<p>“My God, I didn’t do it—as God sees me, I didn’t!”
he cried. “Perhaps I might, if he’d given me a chance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
but he didn’t; he held a gun on me at first, and then
when he laid it on the table I couldn’t——”</p>

<p>The sergeant of police shook him silent and gave
him his warning. “Least said’s the soonest minded
for you, me b’y. Ivery wurrud ye say’ll be used against
ye. Come on wid us.”</p>

<p>“But I say I didn’t!” quavered the boy. “Ask
Mr. Brant, there; he was here, and he knows.”</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon Brant. In the excitement
of the moment no one had thought of him as
having been a witness to the tragedy. It was known
that Harding and young Langford had occupied the
card room together, and the earliest comers had supposed,
if they thought anything about it, that Brant
had merely outrun them in the rush to the scene.
Jarvis alone seemed to comprehend the situation,
and his pencil flew swiftly in the moment of strained
silence following Langford’s appeal. Brant faced
the battery of eyes without flinching and stepped
forward.</p>

<p>“The boy is right,” he said quietly. “I do know—and
I am ready to go with you.”</p>

<p>It was characteristic of time and place that a low
buzz of applause greeted the announcement. “That’s
Plucky George, every day in the week!” said one who
knew him; and at the mention of the name the buzz
went around again. But Sergeant McCafferty was not
to be so easily turned aside.</p>

<p>“Do I understand that ye surrinder yourself as the
murtherer of this man?” he demanded, with a jerk of
his thumb toward the limp figure on the floor.</p>

<p>In the hush that followed Jarvis’s pencil paused,
and the reporter thought it a measure of Brant’s fortitude
that he could smile.</p>

<p>“I am not required to criminate myself before witnesses,”
was the reply. “I neither deny nor affirm;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
but I am ready to go with you and to answer to the
charge at the proper time and place.”</p>

<p>He held out his wrists for the handcuffs, but the
sergeant ignored the gesture and contented himself
with searching his prisoner for weapons.</p>

<p>“You come along wid us quietlike, and there won’t
be no use for the darbies,” he said. “Officer Connell,
ye’ll bring the b’y.”</p>

<p>But Brant protested quickly. “What for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“As a matther of discreetion. I know fwhat
I’m doing,” retorted the sergeant. “Come on wid
you.”</p>

<p>“Not a step till you turn the boy loose,” said Brant
firmly; “at least, not peaceably. I appeal to the
crowd. You have just as good reasons for arresting
every person in this room as you have for taking this
young man. You may say he is a witness; but in that
case I ask who gave you the authority to arrest witnesses?”</p>

<p>It was a bold stroke and the argument was altogether
specious, but Brant knew he could count upon
the moral influence of the onlookers, and in this he was
not disappointed. A murmur of encouragement answered
the appeal, and when the sergeant hesitated
Jarvis put in his word.</p>

<p>“You know me, McCafferty,” he said. “I’ll vouch
for the young man. He is the son of Judge Langford,
and you can find him when you want him.”</p>

<p>The mention of the judge’s name turned the scale,
and William Langford was released. Brant looked his
thanks, and the reporter nodded. Then the officers
moved off with their prisoner, and in the slight confusion
Jarvis got speech with Brant.</p>

<p>“Is there anything I can do for you, old man?” he
whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“Yes; get the boy into a carriage and send him
home.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it. Keep a stiff upper lip, and you’ll come
out all right.”</p>

<p>The reporter fell back when they reached the street,
and a few minutes later Brant was ushered into the
presence of the lieutenant on duty at the police station.
The officer took his name and entered it in the record;
and since the prisoner would answer no other questions,
he presently found himself safe behind bolts and bars
in the city jail, charged with the murder of James
Harding.</p>

<p>There was a cot in the corner of the cell, and when
the turnkey left him Brant flung himself down upon it
in sheer weariness. He had been up the better part of
two nights, and whatever tangle of thought there was
asking to be set in order, sleep was more insistent. But
the trials of the night were not yet at an end. While
he was but dozing, the door bolts clanked and the door
swung open to admit Forsyth. Brant would have risen,
but the editor prevented him and came to sit on the
edge of the cot.</p>

<p>“Don’t disturb yourself,” he made haste to say.
“I haven’t come to fight with you. Jarvis has told me
all about it, and I just came over to let you know that
you have a friend or two left, if you are the biggest fool
on record.”</p>

<p>“That was good of you,” Brant rejoined, and he
would have been less than human if the editor’s kindness
had not touched him. “I was sure you would
come, but I wasn’t expecting you to-night.”</p>

<p>“You might have known I’d be with you as soon as
I could get away from the desk. I presume you will
get your preliminary in the morning?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“I suppose so; though I don’t know anything about
it.”</p>

<p>“It’s safe to count on it, anyway,” Forsyth continued,
“and there are two matters to be arranged in the
meantime—counsel and bail. Give me a list of your
friends, and I’ll go out and hustle for you.”</p>

<p>Brant laughed. “I haven’t reputable friends
enough to furnish bail in a case of assault and battery.
There are plenty of the other kind, but I don’t mean
to call on them—or to let any one else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! what difference can it make now?
You can’t hope to preserve your incognito through all
the publicity of a murder trial.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking of that; and it makes all the
difference in the world to me,” said Brant doggedly.
“I want none of their help, and I sha’n’t accept it—that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Well and good,” replied the editor cheerily. “In
that event I shall have to see what I can do on my own
account.”</p>

<p>“My dear Forsyth, you will do nothing of the kind.
The case will come up at the next term of court, and I
shall stay right where I am until the sheriff’s deputy
comes for me.”</p>

<p>Forsyth did not press the point. The day of reckless
shooting affrays had passed its Colorado meridian—in
the cities, at least—and a healthy public sentiment
was beginning to demand a more stringent interpretation
of the law. Moreover, the Plainsman had
kept well to the front in the law-and-order movement,
and its editor had protested often and vehemently
against the laxity of judges and juries in murder cases.
For this cause he went not unwillingly from the question
of bail to that of counsel.</p>

<p>“Have you made up your mind whom you will have
to defend you?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“No one,” said Brant.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! And why not, pray?”</p>

<p>“I shall plead my own cause.”</p>

<p>“Be your own lawyer and have a fool for a client,
I suppose. But that won’t do at all. I know you have
been living in an atmosphere where, as we say, ‘everything
goes,’ but you mustn’t bank on mining camp
methods in Denver at this late day. The prosecution
here won’t leave you a leg to stand on; it can’t, under
the present pressure of public sentiment.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I shall plead my own cause,” Brant
insisted stubbornly.</p>

<p>“You are not going to be allowed to hang yourself
after that fashion. I shall retain the best lawyer I can
find, and send him to you early in the morning.”</p>

<p>“If you do I shall send him away again.”</p>

<p>The editor got up to tramp back and forth in the
narrow limits of the cell. “What the devil is the matter
with you, anyway?” he demanded. “Can’t you
see that you are sending yourself straight to the gallows?
I tell you, Brant, you don’t realize the change
that has been wrought here even in the last few months.
The jury that acquitted Steve Basket last spring did
what no jury will ever do again in Denver. And if Jarvis
tells a straight story, you haven’t a ghost of a show
without the best legal help you can get.”</p>

<p>“What you say is all true enough, and I realize it
as clearly as you do,” was the calm reply. “But
you are talking quite beside the mark. I am here,
charged with the murder of James Harding, and I am
ready and willing to take what shall befall. I don’t
need a lawyer to help me do that, do I?”</p>

<p>Having no doubt of Brant’s guilt, Forsyth made
haste to interrupt what he feared might lead to an incriminating
confession. “Don’t tell me anything
about it,” he broke in quickly. “We are known to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
intimate, and it is quite as likely as not I shall be called
as a witness against you.”</p>

<p>Brant smiled. “Don’t worry about that. If you
should happen to be summoned you must tell the whole
truth. I sha’n’t gainsay it by so much as a single
word.”</p>

<p>“You are a queer fellow,” was the editor’s comment
after a pause. “Most men in your hard case
would be catching at straws. Are you quite sure you
don’t want counsel?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure.”</p>

<p>“Then is there anything else I can do for you?”</p>

<p>The jailer was returning.</p>

<p>“No, I think not—yes, there is, too. You can keep
young Langford’s name out of the papers, if you will.”</p>

<p>Forsyth shook his head. “It is too late to do that
now, even if it would have been possible earlier—which
it wouldn’t have been, under the circumstances. Is
there nothing else?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that I think of.”</p>

<p>“All right. Keep up your nerve, and try to argue
yourself into a reasonable frame of mind—about employing
counsel, I mean. I’ll see you again in the
morning.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Kate Hobart</span>, California-born and bred,
was of the cheerful salt of the earth, a frank and outspoken
young woman whose vivacity was unfettered,
and to whom mystery and melancholy were alike insupportable.
Having twice entertained the Langfords on
Jack Mountain during the summer, she thought she
knew the family well enough to enjoy a visit in the
Denver household, and so had accepted Mrs. Langford’s
invitation willingly. But after two such depressive
days as had never before been ticked off in any calendar
of hers, days which made her homesick for Jack Mountain,
she went down to breakfast on the Saturday morning
determined to make some excuse—any excuse—for
flight.</p>

<p>But at the breakfast table she was moved to reconsider.
In some manner quite as inexplicable as its
gathering, the storm cloud had lifted in a night; and
for the first time since her darkening of the Hollywood
door she was made to feel that an atmosphere of gloomy
mystery was not the normal respiratory medium of the
household.</p>

<p>As yet, no one save his mother had seen the returned
prodigal, but they all knew he was safe at home.
And since he had seen fit to account for his absence by
a most ingenious paraphrase of the truth, there was no
hint of the terrible story wrapped up in the damp newspaper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
beside the judge’s plate to mar the good cheer of
the meal. Isabel alone appeared to lag in the ascent of
the mount of cheerfulness; whereat her father rallied
her, as fathers will:</p>

<p>“What is it this morning, Bella? Is it the unattainable
Paris art school, or just an everyday picture
that doesn’t paint itself? You look as if you had lost
a friend, or gained an enemy.”</p>

<p>Isabel choked at the unintentional pointing of the
thrust, and Dorothy came to her rescue:</p>

<p>“Don’t be a tease, papa,” she begged. “Isabel is
going to surprise us all some day, and then you will lose
your courtesy title and be known as the father of Miss
Langford, the artist.”</p>

<p>“‘A prophet is not without honour,’” quoted Mistress
Kate. “I think Isabel does very good work;
don’t you, Mrs. Langford?”</p>

<p>“I refuse to call it work,” the mother asserted,
pouring a second cup of coffee for the guest. “It is a
very proper accomplishment for a young woman, and
as such I have always encouraged it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>don’t</i>!” said Isabel, and when the judge
looked up and saw the real distress in her eyes he
changed the subject, or thought to.</p>

<p>“I wonder what has become of Harry lately,”
he remarked, and thereupon Isabel quaked afresh
and nerved herself for the worst that could possibly
be said.</p>

<p>No one seemed to know, and it was Dorothy who
ventured the suggestion that possibly the superintendent’s
prolonged absence and Antrim’s added responsibility
were accountable.</p>

<p>“And who may ‘Harry’ be?” inquired Kate.</p>

<p>“Young Mr. Henry Antrim, the son of an old
friend of ours in Tennessee,” Mrs. Langford explained.
“He is almost a member of the family, I may say,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
added, with a glance in Isabel’s direction which was
not thrown away upon the guest.</p>

<p>The younger daughter dropped her napkin, stooped
to recover it, and so had an obvious excuse for the painful
flush called up by the suggestive reply. Her self-control
was beginning to sag threateningly, and she
gave a little sigh of relief when her father began to
smooth out the morning paper.</p>

<p>“I saw in the paper yesterday that Harry was out
with the president’s car,” he said, straightening the
damp sheet and unfolding it. “Let us see if——”</p>

<p>They all looked up at the abrupt pause. The judge
was sitting very straight in his chair, his thin lips compressed
in two colourless lines, and a gray shadow of
grief and anger spreading slowly from cheek to brow.
The paper trembled a little in his hands, but he read
steadily through the leaded nonpareil under the staring
headlines. Mrs. Langford was the first to find speech.</p>

<p>“Robert!” she cried. “What is it?”</p>

<p>The judge pushed back his chair and rose stiffly, as
one upon whom the palsy of old age had come suddenly.</p>

<p>“Send William to me in the library,” he said, and
his voice had in it something of the judicial sternness
which had so often struck hope out of a culprit’s
heart in the courtroom days. He turned away, and
then he remembered the guest, and came back to apologize
with grave dignity. “You must excuse me—excuse
us all, Mrs. Hobart. We are in great trouble; you
can see for yourself.” And he gave her the newspaper.</p>

<p>He left the room, and Mrs. Langford followed at
once. Kate looked askance at the paper, but she took
it up at Dorothy’s nod. A glance at the staring headlines
appalled her, but she saw that it was no time for
nice distinctions in the conventional field, if she were
to be of the helpers.</p>

<p>“Shall I read it aloud?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“If you please,” Dorothy assented, slipping her arm
around Isabel’s waist.</p>

<p>So Mistress Kate read, and stopped to gasp and
read again:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="large">“‘SACRIFICED TO OSIRIS!</span><br>
<br>
“‘<span class="smcap">WILLIAM LANGFORD AND JAMES HARDING<br>
PLAY CARDS, AND GEORGE BRANT<br>
KILLS THE WINNER!</span></p>

<p>“‘Last night, at the solemn hour of midnight, another
murder was added to the long list of crimes that
have made bloody abattoirs of the temples of chance
here and elsewhere. The “Osirian” clubhouse was the
scene of the grim tragedy. The details of the killing
are somewhat obscure, but it seems that William Langford,
the young son of one of our most respected citizens,
and James Harding, better known as the “Professor,”
met in one of the private rooms of the Osirian
for a quiet game of draw. About midnight a pistol
shot rang out, and those who rushed to the scene found
Harding weltering in his blood. He had been shot in
the face as he sat in his chair, the bullet—a 45-calibre
Colt—entering beside the left eye and passing out at
the back to bury itself in the wall.</p>

<p>“‘The affair is shrouded in mystery, which will
probably not be cleared up until the facts are brought
out at the trial. It was at first supposed that young
Langford had fired the fatal shot, but when the officers
were about to arrest him, Brant, whose presence in the
card room is unexplained, stepped out and surrendered
himself. The motive for the crime is not far to seek.
It is said, by those who know both, that Brant and the
“Professor” have long been deadly enemies; and as
the former had been seeking the latter at the various
resorts in the city, it is supposed that the killing was
the culmination of an old feud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“‘Harding’s record is most unsavoury, and he has
more than once been a fugitive from justice. The reports
about his slayer are conflicting, some asserting
that he is no other than “Plucky George” Brant, the
notorious snap-shot faro dealer of the mining camps,
while others say he is a civil engineer in the employ of
the C. E. &amp; W. Ry.’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dorothy went white at the third line of the heading
and drew closer to her sister; and Kate was scarcely
less moved when she put the paper down at the end.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it just simply dreadful!” she said; and the
trite phrase showed how far beyond adequate speech the
dreadful thing was.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s lips moved, but they were too dry to form
even the single word of assent, and it was Isabel who
answered:</p>

<p>“Indeed it is; it’s too awful to realize. But we all
ought to be so thankful that Will was cleared so quickly
and so easily.”</p>

<p>Dorothy drew herself up and stared at her sister as
if she doubted that she had heard aright. Was it so
easy, then, to choose between one’s lover and one’s
brother?</p>

<p>“But, sister, is it any less terrible for that?” she
cried out reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I suppose not. It is too awful to think
about, anyway. But it is just what one would expect
of Mr. Brant—the giving himself up, I mean. I wonder
if what the paper says about him is true—about his
double identity.”</p>

<p>“How can you think of that now!” Dorothy
burst out passionately. “Of course it isn’t true; and
even if it were—” She stopped short and caught her
breath in a quick gasp, suddenly remembering Brant’s
parable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“I am afraid it is true,” said Kate sorrowfully.
“He is an old friend of Ned’s, and Ned would never
tell me how he came to meet him in Silverette, or what
Mr. Brant was doing there.”</p>

<p>Dorothy’s heart was too full for any kind of utterance.
The open disgrace brought upon the family by
her brother; the terrible tragedy for which she felt
that her letters to Brant were partly responsible; the
dreadful fate that awaited the slayer of James Harding,
and Isabel’s apparent indifference thereto—these were
all past speech. And when there came a dim suspicion
of a more horrible thing—a bare suggestion that Brant
had shielded the real murderer by giving himself up in
his stead—she burst into tears and ran from the breakfast
room.</p>

<p>In the meantime William Langford was having an
exceedingly painful quarter of an hour in the library.
Much to her dissatisfaction, Mrs. Langford had not
been permitted to accompany her son in the capacity
of special pleader, and for once in his life the young
man was compelled to face his father’s wrath unsupported,
while his mother awaited the outcome with what
fortitude she could summon in the deserted drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Tell me the whole story, and tell me the truth,”
was the judge’s stern command when his son appeared
before him.</p>

<p>William did neither. From long practice in presenting
his own case at home in the most favourable
light the young man was blankly unable to tell a
straightforward story in plain words, though for this
once his will to do it was good. But what he did tell
put his father in possession of a fairly consistent series
of facts. On the day before the tragedy the boy had
met Harding and had become his guest at a hotel.
There had been liquor and cards, he admitted—so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
much of the former that he had been afraid to come
home. That was all.</p>

<p>“And how did you come to be in this place last
night?”</p>

<p>“Harding took me there. He said it was a gentlemen’s
club.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know it was a gambling house?”</p>

<p>The boy hung his head. “I—I guessed it was—after
we got in.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“We went upstairs and began to play cards. Harding
won everything I had, and then—” He stopped,
but the lash of his father’s command struck him
smartly.</p>

<p>“Tell it all. What then?”</p>

<p>“Then he got me to put my promise to get some
papers away from Mr. Brant up against all the money
on the table. I thought he was just joking, y’know,
and I did it—and he won.”</p>

<p>The judge groaned in the bitterness of his spirit.
“It wasn’t enough for you to be a knave; you must be
a fool as well. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Then he said I must pay; that if I didn’t, he’d
give me away for what I did the night before.”</p>

<p>“And what was that?”</p>

<p>Again the boy hung his head and went dumb. “I
don’t know. I can’t remember.”</p>

<p>“Which is another way of saying that you were
too drunk to know what you were about. God help
us!” said the judge, and he got up to walk to the window.
When he could trust himself to speak he began
again:</p>

<p>“About these papers that Harding wanted you to
get from Brant: what were they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—some affidavits or something that
Brant was holding over him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“How were you to get them?”</p>

<p>“Any way I could. I was—to—steal them—I suppose.”</p>

<p>“And you—you deliberately put your honour, my
honour, the good name you have made a hissing and a
reproach, on the table as a stake in a game of cards!”</p>

<p>“I—I thought it was only a joke—before God, I
did! And when I found out it wasn’t, I kicked, and we
quarrelled.”</p>

<p>The dreadful suspicion that had just sent Dorothy
sobbing to her room seized upon the judge and gripped
him till his knees trembled. “You—you quarrelled?”
he echoed. “Go on—go on, my son; let me know the
worst.”</p>

<p>It is a hardened son indeed who can look unmoved
upon the vicarious anguish of a father. William Langford
was not unmoved, but the churlish habit had
grown to be second nature, and all the gates of generous
expression were closed and barred. He went on
as if it were another’s story, and not his own, that he
was telling.</p>

<p>“He cursed me, and said I’d have to do it. I swore
I wouldn’t, and when I started to get up he held his
gun on me. That scared me, but it made me madder,
too, and I told him I wouldn’t talk any more till he put
that gun down. He did put it down—laid it on the
table—and I jumped for it. I don’t know just what I
meant to do if I got hold of it. Part of the time I
wanted to kill him, and part of the time I was scared
stiff for fear he’d kill me.”</p>

<p>The culprit stopped to take breath. The effort of
such continuous truth-telling was exhausting.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the father.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I can—so that you’ll understand.
When I jumped for the pistol everything seemed to
happen at once. The room was only a little box of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
place, lighted by an electric globe sticking out from the
wall at the end nearest the door. There was a big
chandelier hanging from the ceiling right over the
table, but that wasn’t lighted. Just as I jumped up
the light went out with a smash, and there were three
of us grabbing for the pistol on the table, instead of
two. I got hold of it, somebody snatched it and
pushed me back, and the shot was fired, all in the same
breath. Then some one on the outside snapped the key
of the big chandelier, and I saw that Harding was shot
right where he sat.”</p>

<p>The judge crossed the room unsteadily and laid his
hand on his son’s head. “William, you say ‘the shot
was fired’; tell me, as you hope to be forgiven, did you
fire that shot?”</p>

<p>The boy hesitated, doubting for the moment his
ability to answer the question truthfully. The memories
of the past eight-and-forty hours were like those of
a fantastic dream in which a single incident more or
less was hard to affirm or deny.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t think I did,” he stammered. “Most
of the time I’m sure I didn’t; I was sure of it when
the officers started to take me, and told ’em so. But
there is a queer thing about it that I can’t understand.
I told you that I grabbed the pistol in the dark, and
that somebody snatched it from me just as the shot was
fired. That’s true, and I’d swear to it if I stood on the
gallows. But when the thing was done, I found that
pistol in my hand just as if I’d never let go of it, and I
threw it on the floor as if it had been hot and burned
me.”</p>

<p>“But surely you can remember whether you fired it
or not!”</p>

<p>“It seems as if I’d ought to, but I can’t. I was
stunned and scared up and crazy mad all in one
breath, and the whole thing happened before you could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
swallow twice. I’m glad I don’t have to remember.”</p>

<p>“Don’t have to remember? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, Brant settled it when he gave himself up,
didn’t he? And yet, if he hadn’t done that, I’d have
been ready to swear that he didn’t fire the pistol,
either.”</p>

<p>The judge shook his head despairingly. “This uncertainty
of yours is simply maddening, William. If
you know you didn’t fire the shot yourself, why do you
think Brant didn’t fire it?”</p>

<p>“Because the noise didn’t seem near enough, and I
didn’t see any flash. The room was dark, y’know, and
rattled as I was I’d ought to have seen it if it had been
fired as close to me as that.”</p>

<p>The judge shook his head again, and began to pace
the floor in a fresh access of grief and humiliation.
But the exigencies of the case presently asserted themselves.</p>

<p>“I believe you have told me the truth, or that you
have tried to tell it. But you must pull yourself together
and get the facts in the shape of a consistent
story. You will be put upon the witness stand, and
Brant’s life may depend upon your testimony.”</p>

<p>The clang of the front-door bell broke in upon
them, and the painful interview was at an end. The
caller was an officer, come to summon William Langford
as a witness in the preliminary examination, which
was set for ten o’clock. The judge groaned inwardly
at this fresh proof of the relentless march of publicity
and disgrace, but he got his hat and coat and went with
his son.</p>

<p>There were no new developments in the courtroom.
William Langford told his story more coherently than
the judge had believed it could be told; and, in accordance
with his expressed determination, Brant refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
counsel and maintained a stubborn silence.
Hence the magistrate, having no alternative, ordered a
plea of “Not guilty” to be entered for him, remanded
him to jail, and fixed his bail at the sum of ten thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>Forsyth and Antrim were both present at the preliminary
examination, and after it was over the latter
introduced Judge Langford and the editor. True to
his promise to befriend Brant in the time of need, the
judge immediately offered to procure bondsmen, but
Forsyth shook his head.</p>

<p>“It is no use,” he explained. “He won’t accept
bail, and I can’t even get him to consent to employ
counsel.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir, that is sheer folly! Indeed, in
this case it is worse than folly—it is suicide.” So said
the judge, and so he fully believed.</p>

<p>“I know it; that is just what I tell him. But he is
as stubborn as a mule.”</p>

<p>The lawyer in the judge awoke at this, and he became
interested at once on the part of the mulish one.
“What reason does he give, pray?”</p>

<p>Forsyth hesitated, not knowing precisely how far
he might confide in the questioner. So he felt his way:</p>

<p>“He doesn’t give any reason; he simply refuses to
talk. But I have my own theory. We are all friends
of his, I take it, and I may speak plainly?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is a singular fellow in some respects, and
you can’t apply the law of averages. I believe he did
the thing deliberately, and for some reason which does
not appear on the surface. And, having done it, he
means to let the law take its course without opposition—to
take the consequences.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said the judge reflectively; then he remembered
how easy it would have been for Brant to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
shifted suspicion to Will, and his heart warmed toward
the culprit. “We mustn’t allow that, Mr. Forsyth.
Of course, the court will assign him counsel at the trial
whether he wants it or not, but we mustn’t let it come
to that. Do you see him again, and endeavour to make
him listen to reason.”</p>

<p>Forsyth promised to do what he might toward that
desirable end, and the judge and his son left the courtroom
together. The editor followed with Antrim, and
when the Langfords were out of earshot the chief clerk
put in his word:</p>

<p>“You may say what you please, Forsyth, but I am
not going to believe that Brant did it till he admits it
himself.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear boy, hasn’t he as good as admitted
it already?”</p>

<p>“No. In what little he has said he has dodged
that point very cunningly.”</p>

<p>“Of course he has; that is the proper thing to do.
He is not obliged to criminate himself.”</p>

<p>“It is proper enough, as you say, but, don’t you see,
it doesn’t fit into your theory. If he killed the man
and is determined to take the consequences, why on
top of earth shouldn’t he plead ‘Guilty’ and be done
with it?”</p>

<p>That was a logical question, and Forsyth was unable
to answer it. When he had said as much the inevitable
alternative suggested itself, and he spoke of it:</p>

<p>“If you exonerate Brant, you put the boy in a bad
box.”</p>

<p>Antrim had thought about that. “I can’t help it,”
he said promptly. “The tree will have to lie where it
falls. If you go back to motives, you will have to admit
that, according to his own story, the thing looks bad
for Will. He was the one who was quarrelling with
Harding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“Yes, but—pshaw! I can’t believe it, Antrim.
Why, he is only a boy!”</p>

<p>“That is true. But it is also true that he is a
young tough, hot-headed and quick-tempered. I have
known him all his life, and neither the thing itself nor
the denial of it is much beyond him.”</p>

<p>They had reached the corner where Antrim should
turn aside to go to his office, and the editor stopped and
regarded his companion curiously.</p>

<p>“You are a friend of the Langfords, aren’t you?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“If they have a better one, I don’t know it. But
right is right. I should say the same if Will Langford
were my own brother,” Antrim asserted stoutly. “I
know you won’t agree with me, and I don’t expect any
one else will, but I say George Brant isn’t guilty, and,
unless he admits it himself in so many words, I am going
to stick to it till the last dog is dead.”</p>

<p>Forsyth went his way unconvinced, but it was inevitable
that Antrim’s suggestion should colour the
editor’s talk with Brant that afternoon. And the colouring
had its effect, too, though not in the way Forsyth
would have wished. While the prisoner said little,
and no thing of that little that could be construed
into an admission of guilt, the editor left the jail with
his own assumption confirmed and fortified beyond a
question of doubt. Furthermore, he had failed utterly
in the renewed attempt to make Brant listen to reason
in the matter of employing counsel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>SHOWING HOW FAITH MAY OUT-BUFFET A FACT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a great misfortune threatens, the heavens
are darkened and the smaller ills are obscured; but
when the eclipse passes, the lesser evils magnify themselves,
assuming abnormal proportions in a field wherein
they are no longer secondary. What time Judge
Langford was oppressed by the fear that his son had
added a murder to the sum of his iniquities, the disgrace
consequent upon the dragging of the family name
into the public prints seemed trifling. But when it
became apparent that William was not to be hanged,
the lesser misfortune demanded a hearing, and the
judge shut himself up in his library to mourn over the
wreck of the good name he had builded.</p>

<p>To him in his sorrowful seclusion came Dorothy,
grief-stricken and incoherent, staggering under a burden
of remorseful anguish too heavy to be borne alone.
The judge loved his elder daughter with an affection
which was both tenderer and less prideful than
that shared by the younger; and he postponed his
private grief in the effort to measure and assuage
hers.</p>

<p>“What is it, Dorothy, daughter—anything worse
than the worst?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, papa; and it is all my fault!” she sobbed,
leaning against the high mantel and covering her face
with her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Your fault? But I don’t understand. What is it
that is your fault?”</p>

<p>“A good part of what has happened, and all that is
going to happen. Mr. Brant was in that place last
night because I had asked him to go. He was looking
for Will, to bring him home.”</p>

<p>“But you say you had asked him. How could that
be?”</p>

<p>Dorothy dried her eyes and told the whole story
bravely, beginning with the chance meeting in Mr.
Crosswell’s study, and ending by handing her father
the two notes received from Brant. The judge read
the notes thoughtfully and the lines of anxiety deepened
in his face.</p>

<p>“You did it for the best, and no one could have
foreseen such terrible consequences. It was a most
natural thing for you to do, and I am far from reproaching
you. But you are right; this complicates
the affair most grievously. It makes us in a certain
sense responsible, and that without helping to clear up
the mystery. If the young man’s purpose was to rescue
William—and that seems to be very evident—why
under heaven should he spoil a good deed by committing
a murder in the very midst of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, I don’t know! But if I hadn’t
sent him he wouldn’t have been there!”</p>

<p>“No, probably not; but you mustn’t try to carry
more than your proper share of the burden. Whatever
his motive for killing the man, it must surely go back
of Harding’s connection with William.”</p>

<p>“If I could only be sure of that!” sighed Dorothy;
and then she added hopelessly: “Not that it would
make any difference. It is done, and it can never,
never be undone.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would make some difference,” said the father
reflectively; “not in fact, but in the ethics of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
fact. Nevertheless, it would not greatly lessen our responsibility.
We must make this young man’s cause
our own now, at any cost.” Here spoke the loyal
Southern gentleman.</p>

<p>“And he can be cleared—you can save him?” she
faltered, brightening up a little.</p>

<p>But her father shook his head doubtfully at
that.</p>

<p>“It would be more than any one could promise at
present; he is acting very singularly”—and Dorothy’s
hopes were slain when the judge told the story of the
preliminary examination. When she had heard him
through, the horrible suspicion came again and refused
to be driven away, but she could not bring herself to
speak of it to her father. Will a murderer? Oh, no;
anything but that!</p>

<p>Not until his daughter had gone away and he had
sat down to go thoughtfully over the details again did
the judge realize what his championship of Brant would
require of him. Then it became evident, with a keen
pang of fresh misfortune, that he was bound hand and
foot; that any effort made to clear Brant must inevitably
result in entangling his own son. As the matter
rested, William was free and unsuspected, and George
Brant would hang—if the jury so willed. But if by
any effort of any one Brant should be proved innocent— The
alternative was as plain as the handwriting
on the wall of Belshazzar’s banquet hall, and to the
full as appalling.</p>

<p>The luncheon hour came and went unheeded, and
the autumn afternoon waned toward a cloudy evening,
and still the judge plodded wearily back and forth in
the narrow space between his writing table and the
bookcases, striving with his paternal love as many a
father has striven since the day when Abraham the Just
was commanded to make trial of his faith. It was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
father against the man, and what wonder if, after all
the hours of stern conflict, the father won?</p>

<p>“I can not do it,” he said at length, setting his face
flintwise against all arguments. “A man’s first duty
is to his own flesh and blood. If William were guilty
it would be different; though even then I doubt if I
could play the Roman. No, Brant must take his
chance; I can’t help him.”</p>

<p>So saying, the judge went up to dress for dinner;
but his decision did not prevent him from telephoning
to Antrim as he came down again, asking the chief
clerk to come to the house that evening.</p>

<p>Antrim promised readily enough, the more willingly
since he suspected the reason for the summons and
hoped to be able to do something in Brant’s behalf.
Accordingly, he boarded a car immediately after supper
and was presently set down in the Highlands. Isabel
met him at the door and would gladly have been plastic;
but Antrim was, in his way, a man of one idea at a time,
and at that moment he was too full of concern for his
friend to think overmuch of his own affair. Whereat
Isabel was piqued, and the angel of reconciliation
spread its wings and flew away.</p>

<p>“Is your father at home?” Antrim asked, after
what Isabel thought was the coldest of greetings.</p>

<p>“Yes, my father is at home, and he is in the
library,” she replied, with the accent precise. And
when Antrim disappeared she went back to the drawing-room
and played many unmusical staccato exercises
on the piano.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Harry,” said the judge, greeting
his visitor cordially. “Come in and sit down; you
have been neglecting us lately.”</p>

<p>Antrim admitted it in one word, not wishing to go
a-swimming in that pool.</p>

<p>“I asked you to come over because I wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
have a talk with you about Brant,” the judge went on.
“You know him better than any of us, and I thought
you might have some suggestions to offer. He mustn’t
be allowed to hang himself without benefit of clergy.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what he is going to do,” replied
Antrim, who had been to see the prisoner in the
city jail during the afternoon. “He won’t talk about
bail; and I can’t get him to listen to a word about having
a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“What does he say?” queried the judge.</p>

<p>“As nearly nothing as a man can and keep on talking.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about the affair yourself,
Harry?—any more than the newspapers tell, I mean.”</p>

<p>“How much do you know?” asked Antrim cautiously,
not wishing to betray Dorothy.</p>

<p>The judge smiled. “I know all that Dorothy can
tell me,” he rejoined.</p>

<p>“All right; then that lets me out, though I haven’t
much to add. We were out together nearly all Thursday night,
looking for Will, and we arranged to go
out again last night. Brant seemed to have found
out something during the day, for in the evening he
gave me a description of this man Harding, and told me
I’d be likely to find him and Will together. When we
separated I was to go to the hotels and lodging houses,
and he was to make the round among the dives.”</p>

<p>The judge remembered his talk with Brant after the
Draco raid and William’s first home-bringing, and was
once more able to put two and two together. “It is
very evident that there are some earlier chapters to the
story,” he said, “and if Brant won’t tell us about them
we must find some one who will. It may be there are
extenuating circumstances in the background which
will help out at the trial.”</p>

<p>He rose and pressed the bell-push; and Antrim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
made haste to define his own position before an interruption
should slay the opportunity.</p>

<p>“You are going on the supposition that Brant is
guilty,” he said quickly. “I don’t believe he is.”</p>

<p>“You don’t?” The judge’s tone evinced more deprecation
than he could honestly lay claim to. “But,
my dear boy, have you considered the alternative?”</p>

<p>“No.” Antrim admitted it frankly. “I haven’t
looked at it in that light at all. But I know Brant,
and I think I know him pretty well. I don’t believe
he is any more capable of killing a man in cold blood
than I am.”</p>

<p>“I know; but that is only inference. You forget
the evidence—” The judge was going on to summarize
the evidence, but the coming of the servant interrupted
him. “Yes, I rang,” he said to the housemaid.
“Ask Mrs. Hobart if she will be good enough
to come to the library.”</p>

<p>Kate complied at once, and the judge introduced
Antrim. “Have this chair, Mrs. Hobart,” he said.
“We were discussing the mur—the tragedy of last
night. Mr. Antrim is a friend of Brant’s, and I understood
you to say that your husband knows him well.
Can you tell us anything of his history?”</p>

<p>Kate shook her head slowly, and, being inclined at
times to be wary out of all proportion to her sex and
age, replied guardedly: “Nothing more than that he
and Ned were college classmates.”</p>

<p>“Have you written to your husband yet?”</p>

<p>“No; I thought he would get the papers before he
would my letter.”</p>

<p>“So he will; but I think it will be well to ask him
to come down. You might write to-night, and Mr.
Antrim will mail your letter.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do better than that—I’ll wire,” said Kate.
“May I write at your table?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>She wrote the message and gave it to Antrim, and
after a little more talk the chief clerk took his leave.
He found his way to the front door alone, and Isabel
watched his departure from the stairhead; after which
concession to her pique she went to her room and did
penance after the fashion of quick-tempered lovers the
world over.</p>

<p>Antrim took a car and left it at the corner nearest
the telegraph office. Ten steps from the crossing he
ran upon Jarvis, and the reporter began forthwith to
ransack him for details in Brant’s affair. Antrim set
his teeth upon a resolve to tell nothing, and ended by
telling all he knew, salving his conscience by reasserting
his belief in Brant’s innocence.</p>

<p>“Right there is where I am stuck myself, but I am
going to settle that point before I’m an hour older,”
quoth the reporter, adding, “You may come along and
help, if you want to.”</p>

<p>“Settle it?” echoed Antrim. “How can anybody
do that?”</p>

<p>“You stay right with me and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>They went on together, first to the Western Union
office, that Antrim might do his errand, and then to
the Osirian. On the way to the clubhouse Jarvis
stopped short and smote his thigh.</p>

<p>“By Jupiter, Harry, but your part of the story turns
on an oxy-hydrogen side light that beats the moon! I’ll
bet a gold mine to an Indian cayuse that I’ve got the
whole play down pat. Here is the layout: He is soft on
the girl; he goes on a still hunt for the girl’s brother; he
catches his Toughness killing him a man for breakfast,
and coolly steps into Mr. Brother’s shoes—all for the
sake of the girl. That is George Brant to a hair, if
I’m any judge of my kind. Come on till I prove it to
you like twice two.”</p>

<p>Antrim went aghast at the bare possibility, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
held his peace and followed Jarvis blindly. The reporter’s
calling procured them ready admission to the
exclusive palace of Chance, and they found the room
on the second floor untenanted, as it was sure to be.
Jarvis posted his companion near the door and in line
with the end of the table where Brant must have stood.
Then he placed the chairs on either side of the table,
about where they were when Harding and Langford
had sat in them. The stage set, he began his demonstration:</p>

<p>“Now, we know that Harding was hit on the side
of his face nearest to you, but that proves nothing more
than that he might have turned away just at the moment
of the firing. But if you will hold the end of
this tape, I’ll show you that Brant couldn’t have fired
that shot from your end of the table, unless it turned
a corner in Harding’s head.”</p>

<p>He unwound the tape, gave one end of it to Antrim,
and drew it taut as nearly as might be through the
space where the murdered man’s head must have been.
That done, he turned and stared blankly at his assistant.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Antrim demanded.</p>

<p>“B’gosh, I’ve proved too much!” said the reporter.
“Can’t you see? The bullet that made this hole in the
wall was fired from about where you stand. By Jove!
that lets young Langford out, but say, it puts Brant in
head over ears!”</p>

<p>Antrim dropped his end of the tape and thrust his
hands into his pockets. “Just the same, I don’t believe
it,” he said doggedly. “And, what’s more, I
never will until Brant admits it himself.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” cried Jarvis heartily. “You
are the kind of a friend to have at a pinch! Well, there
is nothing more to be found out here. Let’s go down
and have a drink, and then you’ll tell me more about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
that burglary business. I was so full of this other
thing that I didn’t quite catch on.”</p>

<p>“No drinks,” said Antrim briefly when they were
once more in the street and Jarvis was pointing for a
barroom. “Come up to Mrs. Seeley’s with me, if you
like, and I’ll tell you and show you all there is to be
heard and seen.”</p>

<p>Jarvis acquiesced, grumbling, and the chief clerk
was as good as his word. But if the reporter made any
fresh discoveries in Brant’s room he kept his own
counsel. By this time Antrim was catching at straws.
The meeting with Jarvis and the experiment with the
tape measure in the card room damped his courage, and
left his belief in Brant’s innocence more nearly shaken
than it had been at any time during the eventful day.
None the less, he remained steadfast, as his last word
to Jarvis testified.</p>

<p>“You are interested in getting to the bottom of
this thing on general principles, aren’t you?” he
asked, as he let the reporter out at the street door.</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“I supposed so. Well, you just go ahead on the
supposition that Brant didn’t do it, and you will be
more likely to succeed. Good night.”</p>

<p>“You are a crank,” said the reporter, laughing, as
he ran down the steps.</p>

<p>And yet such is the impact of one man’s assertion
hurled repeatedly against a wall of self-evident fact
that Jarvis actually found himself ignoring the evidence
and building theories based on the major “if.”
He toppled them over as fast as they rose, but they
straightway grew again, and it took another conference
with his chief, the night editor, to fully fortify his reason
against the assaults of Antrim’s insistent faith.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>HOW THE JUDGE GAVE OF HIS BEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> done what he might for his friend on the
Saturday, Antrim thought he should not err in devoting
the Sunday afternoon to his own affair, and to this
end he turned his face to the Highlands as soon as he
could break away from the Sunday duties which entangle
the railway servant. He was a little later than
usual; and Isabel, after waiting half an hour, avenged
her pique by going out with Mrs. Hobart. Dorothy,
meeting Antrim at the gate as she was starting for the
mission school, was unable to tell him whither they had
gone. Wouldn’t he go in and wait?</p>

<p>Piqued in his turn, Antrim decided he would not go
in and wait. He had meant to do no more at present
than to try to resume the old relation with Isabel, and
he thought she might have suffered this, the more willingly
since it was her own expressed wish. But if she
were not yet complaisant——</p>

<p>Before he had argued the case to its irritant
conclusion he found himself walking townward with
Dorothy. They missed a car by a minute or two,
and Antrim halted at the corner to wait for the
next.</p>

<p>“I have time enough, and we can walk on until a
car overtakes us, if you care to,” said Dorothy, who had
a reason of her own for desiring an uninterrupted interview
with her companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“I’d like to walk,” replied Antrim, whose mood
welcomed a diversion of any sort.</p>

<p>They went on together, and mutual constraint immediately
thrust a barrier of silence between them.
Antrim thought he knew enough of Brant’s secret to
make him hesitate to speak first of the thing which he
imagined was uppermost in Dorothy’s mind; and Dorothy
was made dumb by a great sympathy for Antrim in
his disappointment. None the less, she was the first
to break the silence.</p>

<p>“Have you—have you been to see Mr. Brant since
the—” She could not give it a name, and Antrim
promptly forestalled the necessity.</p>

<p>“Yes; I was with him for half an hour yesterday
afternoon.”</p>

<p>Dorothy meant to go straight on to the end she
had in view, but her courage failed, and she had to
bridge the gap with a commonplace. “Isn’t it dreadful!”
she said.</p>

<p>“That depends upon how you look at it,” rejoined
Antrim, forgetting for the moment to whom he was
talking. “I don’t believe Brant is guilty.”</p>

<p>“O Harry!” Dorothy stopped, and the quick tears
blinded her.</p>

<p>Whereupon Antrim realized, with a pang of remorse
for his thoughtlessness, what such an assertion must
mean to William Langford’s sister, and he made haste
to comfort her.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t take it for granted that I am accusing
Will. I am not; I just leave him out of the
question altogether, and stick to Brant for what I know
of him. He wouldn’t do such a thing any more than I
would.”</p>

<p>Dorothy could not so easily avoid the apparently
inevitable conclusion, but her enthusiasm rose unbidden
at the tribute to the worth of the man whom she loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“I want to think so too, Harry—oh, <i>so</i> much! But
papa says he doesn’t deny it.”</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t; and he doesn’t affirm it, either.
And till he does, I am not going to believe it,” said Antrim
stoutly.</p>

<p>At this conjuncture it occurred to Dorothy that
Antrim was behaving very nobly toward his successful
rival, and she found space to lay a little offering on the
altar of manly friendship.</p>

<p>“It is very generous of you, Harry, to feel that
way after what has happened. I have been afraid you
might feel just the least bit vindictive.”</p>

<p>“Vindictive? You don’t know what I owe him,
Dorothy. It is a bigger debt than I ever owed any one
before, and I’d pay it if it took the last thing I have
in the world.”</p>

<p>“It has taken the thing you valued most, hasn’t
it?” said Dorothy, with heartfelt sympathy in voice
and eyes. “Poor Isabel! It is a dreadful blow for
her! And she is taking it so strangely.”</p>

<p>Antrim was properly mystified, but he got no farther
than to say: “Isabel? I am afraid I don’t quite
understand.”</p>

<p>“Surely she has told you,” said Dorothy, who could
not imagine anything like duplicity on the part of her
outspoken sister.</p>

<p>Now Isabel had told him but one thing of any
considerable importance to a lover, and Antrim’s
thought naturally reverted to that thing.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he rejoined, trying to speak lightly.
“She gave me my quittance for good and all a while
back, but—” He was going on to add that it is a long
lane that has no turning, when Dorothy interrupted:</p>

<p>“I knew she would tell you first! And now this
dreadful thing has come between them. Harry, I believe
it will kill her if she has to give him up now. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
is acting so strangely that I fairly tremble for her
reason.”</p>

<p>Antrim throttled a wild impulse to give place to
madness and forced himself to say, as calmly as might
be, “Then she has told you that—that she loves
Brant?”</p>

<p>Dorothy decided on the spur of the moment that it
was no time for half confidences.</p>

<p>“Yes; and that isn’t the worst of it. She sent him
away because—because she didn’t know her own heart,
I suppose. I told her he would come back; and now
he never can. Isn’t it too pitiful!”</p>

<p>Antrim thought it was—in more senses than one.
More than that, it was blankly incredible, or rather it
would be apart from Dorothy’s positive assertion.
Could he have been so purblind as not to have seen
what was going on before his very eyes? Reason said
No; but a misconception, once endowed with the breath
of life, is sure to find plenty to fatten upon, and the
atoms of corroborative evidence began to assemble
quickly with Dorothy’s declaration for a nucleus.</p>

<p>This was why Brant had been so sure that he knew
Isabel’s preference; and he had been mistaken, after
all. This was why he had stopped going to Hollywood,
and why he had been so quick to deny even the hint of
a love affair with Dorothy. And Isabel: had she not
steadfastly refused to say in so many words that she did
not love any one else?</p>

<p>Antrim called himself hard names under his breath,
and in the first flush of the new misery would have been
glad to be able to charge his friend with insincerity.
He saw the injustice of that in time to fight it down,
and then rancour gave place to honest admiration.
How unselfishly Brant had effaced himself, and how
quick he had been to succour and to offer comfort and
countenance to his rival! That, too, seemed incredible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
even to Brant’s best friend; but since incredible things
were the order of the day, it was decently in keeping
with all the other happenings of a time which was
hopelessly out of joint.</p>

<p>So Antrim assured himself, with what resignation
he could command; but for all that, this latest buffet of
the boxer Misfortune was as a bolt from the blue, and
he staggered under it, though not toward the abyss,
since he had lately had his lesson and had profited
by it.</p>

<p>While he was trying to face the necessity of discussing
this newest phase of the many-sided problem
with becoming stoicism a car overtook them and privacy
was at an end. By the time the car had reached
the crossing nearest the mission school he had fought
and won his battle—the fiercest, and, as it chanced, the
most unnecessary, that had ever been thrust upon him—and
was ready with an assurance of good faith which
was quite as sincere as it was costly.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t be discouraged, and we must just go
on hoping against hope,” he said, when he took Dorothy’s
hand at parting. “It is a most intricate tangle,
and I can’t begin to unravel it yet; but you may count
on one thing: what one man may do to help Brant will
be done. You have told me some things that I didn’t
know before, but I shall work all the harder for knowing
them. And if—if you think it will do any good,
you may tell Isabel that.”</p>

<p>After which generous confession of faith he left her
and went to his office, being minded to dull the keen
edge of the new trouble on the grindstone of hard work.
The dulling process was but fairly in train when the
door opened to admit Forsyth.</p>

<p>“Do you allow a man to trespass on Sunday?” he
asked, feeling for the latch of the gate in the counter-railing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“Surely, when the man is as good a friend as you
are. Come in and sit down.”</p>

<p>“It is about Brant, or I shouldn’t trouble you,” explained
the editor, drawing up a chair. “I have been
to see him again, and he is more obstinate than ever—if
that be possible. He said you were there yesterday,
and I came to see if you had been able to do anything
with him.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid you wouldn’t be. Have you anything
new to offer?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have. It is pretty plain to you that Brant
will hang, lacking strong counsel, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Plainer than I wish it were.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Now there is just one lawyer in
Christendom, so far as I know, whose services he can’t
well refuse.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Judge Langford,” said the editor, crossing his
legs and nursing one knee.</p>

<p>“But, good Lord, Forsyth, you are losing your grip!
Have you forgotten that the judge is William Langford’s
father?”</p>

<p>“I have forgotten nothing. From your point of
view it would be out of the question, I grant you; but
so far as heard from, you are the only person who
doesn’t believe Brant did it. Now I am convinced that
he did, and the judge is quite as sure that he did; so
the difficulties on that side vanish. I don’t see what is
to prevent the judge from taking the case, if he chooses
to.”</p>

<p>“I do. If he should clear Brant it would reopen
the entire question as to Will. You know that as well
as I do.”</p>

<p>“He can’t clear him; nobody can do more than get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
him a light sentence. But if he could clear him, the
boy is well out of it. You were with Jarvis last night,
and you helped him make the discovery that the shot
was fired in line with the door; that it could not well
have been fired from young Langford’s position.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but——”</p>

<p>“But what? Will you say that the judge is an invalid?
or that his family connection with the affair
should exempt him?”</p>

<p>“Ye-yes; either or both. That is about what I
was going to say.”</p>

<p>“Waiving the first objection,—the judge is a good
deal better than a sick man,—the second is precisely the
reason why he should be willing to offer his services—why
he must offer them.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Because the thing happened while Brant was in
the service of the family. You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I do; but I’d like to know how you found it
out.”</p>

<p>Forsyth laughed. “You have forgotten that you
told Jarvis the whole story last night. But no matter
about that: don’t you see the judge’s necessity now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I don’t know but I do. But supposing the
judge doesn’t see it?”</p>

<p>“He must be made to see it; and that brings me up
to date. You know him well; can’t you undertake to
enlist him?”</p>

<p>“Frankly, I can’t; and you have given the reason:
I know him too well. He has been a second father to
me since my own died.”</p>

<p>“All right; I didn’t know,” said the editor, rising
to go. “Somebody has it to do, and I thought perhaps
you might be able to do it best.”</p>

<p>“Who else have you in mind?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. I am going to tackle him myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why not? I know the facts, and not being
a personal friend, I sha’n’t scruple to use them. I am
going over there now. Will you come along?”</p>

<p>“Not unless you make a point of it. I should only
hamper you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t make a point of it. Let me see; the house
is Number Sixteen, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Altamont Terrace. Don’t be too savage
with him, Forsyth. He has had lots of grief lately.”</p>

<p>“He will have more if he shirks in this affair. But
I sha’n’t be any harsher with him than I have to be.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Forsyth rang the Hollywood
door bell, and sent his card to the judge, who presently
received his visitor in the library.</p>

<p>“I am right glad to see you, Mr. Forsyth,” he said,
rising and shaking hands cordially with the editor.
“No, don’t apologize for coming; you are very welcome.
Be seated.”</p>

<p>Forsyth took the proffered chair and plunged at
once into the midst of his errand.</p>

<p>“It is about Brant, as you will infer. Yesterday
you asked me to try again to make him listen to reason
in the matter of employing counsel. I have tried
thrice, and failed.”</p>

<p>“Does he still refuse to give his reasons?”</p>

<p>“He does.”</p>

<p>“And is he fully aware of the probable consequences?”</p>

<p>“As fully aware as we are.”</p>

<p>“H’m! that is bad. Have you anything to suggest,
Mr. Forsyth?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There is one person whose services he can
not well decline.”</p>

<p>“There is? And who is this person?”</p>

<p>“Yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>The judge rose quickly and went to the window,
turning his back upon his visitor. It was full five minutes
before he spoke again, and the editor waited patiently.</p>

<p>“I can scarcely believe you know what you ask, Mr.
Forsyth,” said the judge at length, coming slowly back
to his chair. “If the circumstances were different, if
my own son were not unfortunately involved, I should
be the first to volunteer.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, that is precisely the reason why you
should volunteer,” said Forsyth firmly. “Bear with
me a moment while I show you how the matter presents
itself to an unbiassed outsider. Your son absents himself,
and, knowing his habits, you and the other members
of the family are justly anxious. In response to a
request from one of your daughters——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but how did you learn that? From
him?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I learned it, indirectly, from Miss
Dorothy herself. As I was saying, in response to this
request my friend undertakes the not unhazardous task
of finding and rescuing your son. He does the first,
and in trying to do the second he commits a crime
which, account for it as you may, would not have been
committed at that time and place if Brant had been less
willing to help you and yours. Do I make my point
of view quite clear?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Under such circumstances the least
you can do for my friend is to defend him. No one else
can do it as well. Your mere presence in court as his
counsel may well save his life. Ask yourself the question
seriously, Judge Langford, and if your own sense
of justice will allow you to refuse, I have nothing more
to say.”</p>

<p>The judge leaned back in his chair and stared absently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
at the handful of fire in the grate. Forsyth’s
appeal reopened the question which he thought he had
settled once for all the day before, and the arguments
for and against began once more to marshal themselves
for a fiercer conflict. Before the battle began
he made one more effort to postpone it.</p>

<p>“You ignore the fact that I might end by directing
suspicion against my own son, Mr. Forsyth.”</p>

<p>“I do. I ignore everything but the question of
simple justice and a just man’s obligations.”</p>

<p>The fight was on, and the judge left his chair to
pace the floor with his hands behind him and his head
bowed. Forsyth had told him no new thing. His
duty had been clear enough from the moment of Dorothy’s
confession. But the frankness of the editor’s appeal;
the grave ruthlessness with which he held the responsibility
up as something to be decided apart from
personal considerations—a thing affecting justice, and
honour, and uprightness—this touched him very nearly.
But opposed to this his fatherhood rose up in
mighty protest pleading as only paternal love can plead
for the supremacy over all abstractions of whatsoever
kind or degree. The struggle was long and bitter; and
seeing the story of it writing itself in deeply graven
lines upon the judge’s face as he paced slowly back and
forth, Forsyth had to harden his heart more than once
while he awaited the outcome. “It is the father
against the man, but the man will win,” he said to himself;
and as he prophesied, so it came to pass.</p>

<p>“You have won your cause, Mr. Forsyth.” The
judge stopped before the editor’s chair and spoke abruptly.
“Go you to the young man and tender him
my services, and let me know as soon as may be if he
will accept them.”</p>

<p>Forsyth sprang to his feet and wrung the elder
man’s hand gratefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“God bless you, Judge Langford; it is a noble thing
for you to do! Don’t think for a moment that I
undervalue the cost. And now let me tell you something
which will make your task easier. One of
my young men made some experiments last night
in the card room at the Osirian. The result proved
conclusively that the shot was fired from some point
in line with the door; that it could not well have
been fired from the chair in which your son was sitting.”</p>

<p>“Thank God for that!” exclaimed the judge fervently;
but he added quickly: “I am glad you withheld
that—glad you gave me the opportunity to give
of my best. You will see Brant at once?”</p>

<p>Forsyth hesitated. “As my friend’s friend, I
am entirely at his service and yours. But don’t
you think it will be as well if you go to him unannounced?”</p>

<p>The judge thought about it for a moment.</p>

<p>“In view of his most singular obstinacy, perhaps
it will. It is worth trying, at all events. I will go to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“Thank you again,” said the editor, finding his hat.
“I presume I need not say that we have little time to
lose. The Grand Jury meets to-morrow, and Brant
will doubtless be indicted during the week.”</p>

<p>“So I have been informed. No matter; we shall
be diligent. If the young man will only confide in me
we may be able to discover something which will serve
to—to palliate his crime and to mitigate the severity of
the inevitable sentence.”</p>

<p>So spoke the judge, as though the question of his
client’s guilt was a question fully answered. But when
he went to the door with his visitor he ventured a query
which seemed to admit the thin edge of the wedge of
uncertainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“There is no shadow of doubt in your mind, is
there, Mr. Forsyth?—as to his guilt, I mean.”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” rejoined the editor sorrowfully.
And he went his way saddened by the thought that he
could answer no otherwise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>IN WHICH A WILFUL MAN HAS HIS WAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> obstinacy, like a hound that is beaten, is constrained
to course the truer for the blows of the whipper-in,
two days of confinement and the anxious expostulations
of Forsyth and Antrim appeared to have no
mellowing effect upon the man who stood charged with
the murder of James Harding. So far from it, time
and the friendly efforts of the allies seemed but to crystallize
reticent impulse into a fixed purpose strong to
defeat any helpful emprise on the part of his friends.</p>

<p>Failing to beat down the guard of reticence in any
face-to-face encounter, Forsyth had not been above
bribing the turnkey to spy upon his prisoner; but if
the man’s report was to be believed, the bribe was
money wasted. Brant spent the time in reading, was
calm and cheerful, and cared not to know what the
newspapers were saying about him. A model prisoner
in every respect, and a man whom he (the turnkey)
would be sorry to see hanged.</p>

<p>So ran the purchased report, and to all outward appearances
the morning of the third day of his confinement
found the prisoner in the same equable frame of
mind. But if he fancied he had fortified the gate of
silence until it was proof against the batterings of
friendship, he had left unguarded a postern opening
upon the innermost citadel of whatsoever resolution he
was defending. By this postern he was presently to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
assaulted, as was apparent when the jailer unlocked the
cell door to admit Judge Langford. None the less, he
welcomed his visitor heartily, and with becoming
warmth.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Judge Langford. This is kind of
you. I hardly expected to see you here,” he said, doing
the honours of his cramped quarters as best he might.</p>

<p>The judge stood his cane in a corner and sat down
on the edge of the cot.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t speak well for your good opinion of
me,” he rejoined genially. “At our last meeting—in
your office, if you remember—I gave you to understand
that you had placed me under obligations which I
should gladly repay. Since then you have added somewhat
to the score, and I am here to do what I may to
square the account.”</p>

<p>Brant bowed. If he suspected what was coming he
made no sign, choosing rather to let the judge find his
own way to what was toward.</p>

<p>“After the examination, Saturday, I met your
friend Forsyth—and, by the way, he is a good friend of
yours, too. He tells me that you refuse to employ
counsel, and that without giving any reason. Now we
can not allow that, you know, and to make it impossible
for you to persist, I have this morning taken out a
license to practice in the Colorado courts for the express
purpose of defending you.”</p>

<p>“Of what?” exclaimed the prisoner. It was a
hopeful sign that the judge had beaten down the guard
of self-possession that Brant sprang up and began to
tramp, three steps and a turn.</p>

<p>“Of defending you, I said. And I am here now to
beg you to speak freely to me as client to advocate.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir! it is impossible—utterly impossible!
You don’t know what you have undertaken.”</p>

<p>“I think I do; and I am ready and willing to do my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
best for you. But to that end you must be candid with
me.”</p>

<p>“I say you do not know,” Brant insisted, going back
of the admonition and speaking to the assertion. “Let
me ask you one question, Judge Langford: Have you
remembered that, as my counsel, you would be obliged
to cross-examine your own son?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“Good God! And you would do it? Why—”
The prisoner checked himself suddenly, as one on the
verge of a precipice, faced about, and went on more
calmly: “But you must know that I wouldn’t allow it.
It is the height of generosity and unselfishness on your
part to offer it, but I can not accept—indeed, I can
not.”</p>

<p>“You must accept; it is my privilege to insist.”</p>

<p>“And mine to refuse, ungracious as it may seem. I
can not give you my reasons, and you must not ask
them. But I’ll say to you what I have not said to anybody
else. If I should suffer you to do this thing
which you propose you would never forgive me as long
as you live!”</p>

<p>The judge met him firmly on his own ground.
“That is only adding mystery to mystery. Be frank
with me, Mr. Brant, at whatever cost to yourself, or to
any one.”</p>

<p>There was no reply to this, and the judge pressed
his advantage vigorously. “Let us put away all equivocation
and seek only to understand each other,” he
went on. “You have committed this crime”—the
prisoner looked up quickly, and seemed to draw breath
of relief—“you have committed this crime, and for
some reason, real or fancied, you are determined to
make no effort to save yourself. From a purely self-centred
point of view this may seem right and proper;
but you must remember that no man lives or dies to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
himself. You owe something to your friends; you owe
something to me, since it was at least a part of your
errand last Friday night to find my son and to send him
home.”</p>

<p>“Then you know—” Brant began, but the judge
went on quickly:</p>

<p>“I know that much, and no more. It is for you to
tell me the rest.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it, Judge Langford, and you must forgive
me if I still insist that you do not know what you
are asking of me. I appreciate your kindness more
than I can tell, but I can not suffer it. I have sins
enough to answer for, God knows, without adding another
for which there would be no forgiveness in this
world or the next.”</p>

<p>The judge shook his head slowly. “Your point of
view grows more and more inexplicable, Mr. Brant. In
what possible way could your confidence in me wrong
any one?”</p>

<p>Brant leaned against the wall with folded arms,
the gray eyes narrowing and the firm jaw settling itself
in rigid lines.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the word was ill chosen. But if I should
do as you ask, there would be sorrow and grief and misery
where I would fain see happiness. And for myself
there would be regrets deep and lifelong. You will
say this is more mystery, but I can not help it. I know
quite well what I am doing, and I have counted the cost
to the last farthing. My life has been a sorry failure,
Judge Langford—so poor a thing that I can afford to
give it freely if the law shall demand it.”</p>

<p>The judge pursed his lips and made another step in
the outworking of the problem of deduction.</p>

<p>“Am I to understand by this that free speech on
your part would involve others besides yourself?” he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“It would involve others—yes, many others.”</p>

<p>“Without making your defense less hopeless than
it appears to be at present?”</p>

<p>“Without bringing me anything that I could endure
with half the fortitude that I shall take to the
gallows. No; your sympathy and loving-kindness are
very comforting to me, but you must pardon me if I
say that they are quite undeserved. Whatever the jury
sees fit to give me will doubtless have been earned, and
well earned.”</p>

<p>The judge saw that the time for winning his client’s
confidence was not yet ripe, and he rose and buttoned
his coat.</p>

<p>“You are still giving me riddles, Mr. Brant, and
while you elect to do that, no one can help you intelligently.
I am not going to press you further this morning,
but I shall come again—and yet again. Meanwhile,
I am ready and anxious to act for you the moment
you will permit it. I can’t say more, can I?”</p>

<p>He held out his hand, and Brant’s grasp of it was
not without emotion.</p>

<p>“No one could be kinder than you, Judge Langford;
and some time, in this world or another, you shall
know that I am not ungrateful.”</p>

<p>When the judge was fairly out of the cell and the
sound of his footsteps had died away in the corridor,
Brant threw himself upon the cot and groaned aloud.
But his speech was of gratitude.</p>

<p>“Thank God, that trial is over! If they could devise
many more such torments as that, I’d hang myself
to the grating and have done with it!”</p>

<p>That evening, at nine o’clock, a fact leaked out
which Forsyth hastened to telephone to the house in
the Highlands: the Grand Jury had found a true bill
against George Brant for the wilful murder of James
Harding.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>HOW LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP THREW A MAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> two weeks after the judge’s first interview with
his unwilling client the possibility of successfully defending
Brant receded steadily, and no new discoveries
came to countermine the wall of evidence which was
slowly and surely closing in upon him.</p>

<p>In this interval Colonel Bowran had returned, and,
contrary to Brant’s expectation or desire, had at once
championed his draughtsman’s cause. There had been
more than one stormy interview—they were tempestuous
on the colonel’s part, at least—in which the chief
engineer’s wrath was directed at Brant’s obduracy.
And when expostulation and friendly abuse had failed,
the colonel sought out Judge Langford and Forsyth,
joining forces cordially with the prisoner’s friends, but
bringing nothing helpful in the way of additional information.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the prosecution lacked nothing
but the culprit’s confession of having a complete case.
Brant’s record was exploited, and the details of his
previous quarrel with Harding, or so much of them as
were known to Draco’s bartender, were dragged out of
Deverney as sound teeth are extracted from the jaw of
an unwilling patient.</p>

<p>So much of the State’s side of the case was known
to Brant’s friends—by what means Forsyth’s young
men could best have explained—and there was consternation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
among them in just proportion. If the tide
could not be stemmed before the rapidly approaching
day of the trial, the judge knew he should go
into court without any case. And, making due allowance
for the change that had recently been wrought
in public sentiment, he had every reason to fear the
worst for his client.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Forsyth, the man will hang in spite
of everything we can do.”</p>

<p>So much the judge was impelled to say in one of
the many conferences with the editor, and Forsyth had
nothing to offer in rebuttal.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he will,” said the editor. And then:
“We are all in the same boat, and on the same side of
the boat—all but Harry Antrim. He still asserts his
belief in Brant’s innocence. In his way he is as obdurate
as Brant himself. But it is entirely sentiment
on his part. I wish his faith had a better foundation.”</p>

<p>So Antrim had wished many times; and after having
racked his brain for a fortnight for something tangible
wherewith to buttress his belief, he was finally indebted
to the chapter of accidents for a clew which
seemed to point most hopefully.</p>

<p>It was in the afternoon of that day in which Judge
Langford had summed up Brant’s case in the talk with
the editor. Antrim had been rummaging in his safe
for a missing paper, and had chanced to come upon the
sealed envelope given him by Brant for safe-keeping on
the morning after the burglary at Mrs. Seeley’s.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to send it posthaste to the
judge; his next was to break the seal and read the
sworn evidence of Harding’s guilt in the year-agone
crime committed in Taggett’s Gulch. Five minutes
later he was writing a note to Dorothy, begging her to
come quickly to the office.</p>

<p>Dorothy answered the note in person, and Antrim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
took her into the superintendent’s room and closed the
door. What he had to say brooked neither listeners
nor interruptions.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad you came right away,” he began.
“I was afraid something might hinder you, and
what I want to talk about won’t wait.”</p>

<p>Dorothy sat down in the superintendent’s big
chair and unpinned her veil. “I was just getting
ready to come down for Isabel when Tommie came.
He said it was a ‘rush message,’ so I caught the next
car.”</p>

<p>“That was lucky.” Antrim was tramping up and
down before her, full to bursting with his news. Suddenly
he stopped and confronted her. “Dorothy,
would you still be glad to believe that Brant isn’t
guilty?”</p>

<p>She sat up very straight at this and the sensitive
chin quivered a little. “That is a hard question,
Harry. If it wasn’t Mr. Brant——”</p>

<p>“I know what you are thinking about,” he broke in.
“But just leave Will out of it entirely; try to forget
that he was there.”</p>

<p>“If I could do that, the question—your question—would
answer itself.”</p>

<p>“That is all I want to know. Now I have believed
all along that Brant didn’t do it; and a little while ago
I found some papers which go to show that he could
have no possible motive for doing it. It isn’t necessary
to go over the whole thing, but you will understand
what I mean when I tell you that these papers are
Brant’s, and any time he wanted to get rid of Harding
all he had to do was to turn them over to the district
attorney of Pitkin County. That would have been the
end of Mr. Murderer Harding as soon as they could
catch and hang him.”</p>

<p>“You say you found these papers—where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“In my safe. Brant gave them to me to keep for
him.”</p>

<p>“Do you know why he did that?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I do.” She tugged at the fingers of her glove
and a light came into her eyes that told Antrim more
than she would have admitted by word of mouth under
torture. “It was because he was afraid to keep them;
afraid he might be tempted to let the law do what
everybody is saying he did with his own hand. Harry,
he is innocent!”</p>

<p>“Of course he is; that is what I’ve been saying
all along. Now there are two of us who believe it, and
something has got to be done quick.”</p>

<p>“What had you thought of?”</p>

<p>“I can’t think—I’m too foolishly rattled to think;
and that is why I sent for you. You can plan all
around the rest of us. What do you say?”</p>

<p>Dorothy sat back in the great chair and thought
it all out in the turning of a leaf.</p>

<p>“Mr. Brant must be made to listen to reason,” she
said decisively. “He must let papa defend him; he
must let papa use these papers; and he must tell us all
the things we don’t know.”</p>

<p>Antrim’s gesture was of despair. “Pity’s sake!
that is just what we have all been trying to get him to
do for two whole weeks!”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it; that is what must be done.”</p>

<p>“And done it shall be, if you will only go a step
farther and tell me how we are to bring it about.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you persuade him?”</p>

<p>“Persuade nothing! Why, Dorothy, you haven’t
an idea what a mule the man is! Your father, and
Forsyth, and Colonel Bowran, and I have fairly worn
ourselves out trying to make him open his head. There
isn’t a thing any of us could think of that hasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
been tried; not a— Yes, by Jove, there is one thing,
too!”</p>

<p>An inspiration much too large to be readily clothed
in words came to Antrim, dazzling him with its invincible
simplicity. Dorothy divined it with quick intuition,
and her heart sank within her at the bare suggestion.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked faintly.</p>

<p>“Why, it is the simplest thing in the world! Brant
won’t talk to any of us, but if you will go to him——”</p>

<p>“O Harry—I can’t, I can’t!” she wailed.</p>

<p>But he would not be turned aside. “Yes, you can,
Dorothy, and you must. It is life and death with him
now. Only this morning Forsyth told me it was all
up with him. Think of a man being hanged for a
thing that he didn’t do; think how awful it would be
if you had to remember that you might have done
something to prevent it, and didn’t! Think of—think
of Isabel, Dorothy, and be a brave little sister
of mercy, as you have always been to every one in
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, <i>don’t</i>!” she pleaded pitifully. “Don’t
say any more, Harry. You haven’t any idea of what
you are asking me to do, but I—I’ll go. Can we do it
now—right away—before I have to go home and face
them all again?”</p>

<p>Antrim made a quick dash for his hat and coat, and
they were halfway to the jail before she spoke again.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a very dreadful thing for me to do?” she
asked shamefacedly. “Do—do ladies ever go to see
the prisoners?—alone, I mean.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; and you must not care, Dorothy—not
for this once. I’ll go as far as the corridor with
you and wait till you come out. You must just keep
saying to yourself that it is life and death; and—and
Isabel’s happiness,” he added softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>She caught the inspiration of his unselfishness, and
answered it in kind.</p>

<p>“You are very good and noble, Harry. I’ll remember;
and I’ll try to do my part—as you are doing
yours. Is this the place? Oh, what a terrible Castle
of Despair!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>A FEAST OF MINGLED CUPS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Brant</span> was lying down when he heard the heavy
step of the turnkey in the corridor; heard the heavy
step and a lighter one, and the rustle of a woman’s
dress. He made sure it was another of the cut-flower
faddists who had lately been making his prison life a
hot bath of vicarious shame, and sprang up with a muttered
malediction comprehensive enough to include the
entire procession of the sentimentalists. A moment
later the key grated in the lock, the bolts clanked,
and the door swung back. He stood transfixed for
an instant, hardly daring to believe his eyes. Then
the clamour and crash of the closing door brought
him to his senses and he turned away and hid his
face.</p>

<p>Dorothy stood still, abashed at her own boldness
and waiting timidly for some sign of recognition.
When it was overlong in coming she plucked up courage
and went to him.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you a word of welcome for me, Mr.
Brant?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me. What can I say? Why did you
come?”</p>

<p>“Because you made me,” she said simply. “You
wouldn’t listen to any of the others, you know; and—and—but
you will listen to me. You must.”</p>

<p>He turned to face her, and even in the dim half-light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> 
of the cell she could see that he was nerving himself
for a struggle.</p>

<p>“Please sit down,” he said, pointing to the single
chair. “I think I know what you have come to say,
but it isn’t any use—indeed, it is not.”</p>

<p>She ignored the pointing and the invitation, and
leaned against the wall within arm’s reach of him.</p>

<p>“Please don’t say that—not to me. None of the
others had my right. It was I who sent you.”</p>

<p>He flinched at that and gave ground a little. “You
have a good right, Miss Langford, though it isn’t builded
upon your little cry for help. What would you have
me do?”</p>

<p>“Whatever papa wants you to do,” she rejoined
quickly, deeming it best not to go too deeply into particulars.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to have to refuse you anything; but
this that you ask is altogether impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why is it impossible?”</p>

<p>“Because—God in heaven!—none of you know
what you are asking!”</p>

<p>“Then tell me, so I may know.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do that, either.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you tell me if I guess it?”</p>

<p>The pleading eyes unsteadied him, and he receded
yet another step. “Perhaps,” he said, hesitating.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid that if you defend yourself my
brother will be in danger?”</p>

<p>Is there something in the washing of tears that
gives insight to sympathetic eyes? She saw deep into
him at that moment; saw that to deny her accusation
would be to lie; saw also that he could not look into
her eyes and find words to frame the falsehood. So
she was prepared for the evasion.</p>

<p>“And if that were true, what then?”</p>

<p>“You would be making a terrible and utterly useless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
mistake. Don’t you know—haven’t they told you?
It has been proved that my brother could not have
done it.”</p>

<p>He did not ask how it had been proved. It was
enough that she believed it, and it was the final drop
of bitterness in the cup of expiation that he had
thought to drain bravely to the dregs. To her, as to all
others, save only Antrim, he was a murderer. It was
more than he could bear unmoved, and he turned from
her lest she should see the anguish in his face and be
moved by it to say the thing which was not true. When
he did not reply she spoke again:</p>

<p>“That was the reason, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It was—it <i>is</i>.” The words said themselves because
there was no strength left in him wherewith to
hold them back.</p>

<p>She gave him no time to draw again the sheathed
sword of denial. “I was sure of it. But you won’t
hesitate any longer now, will you?—not after what I
have told you.”</p>

<p>“Hesitate—to tell them I am guilty? No, I shall
not hesitate; I’ll confess to you—here—now, if you
wish.” He faced her suddenly, but again the tear-brightened
eyes and their pleading unmanned him.
“No, I can’t say it to you,” he went on, softening and
becoming as the clay on the potter’s wheel in spite of
himself. “In the eye of the law—in the eyes of the
whole world—I am a murderer, taken in the very act.
But I can not go to my death with the thought that
the only woman I have ever loved believes me guilty
of such a cowardly crime. I did not kill James Harding.”</p>

<p>Dorothy forgot her errand, forgot the papers, forgot
everything in the horror of a great doubt and the
ecstasy of an unchartered joy still greater than the
doubt which suddenly threatened to suffocate her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
Nevertheless, a misunderstanding, rooted and grounded
as hers was, dies hard.</p>

<p>“You mean that I should—that you want me to—to
tell my sister,” she faltered; and she could no
longer look him in the face.</p>

<p>“Your sister!” Brant fought a good fight for self-control
and won it. “No, Dorothy; it is not Isabel’s
belief that troubles me; it is yours. How could you
have misunderstood?”</p>

<p>Dorothy felt her lips growing cold, and the solid
floor of the cell swayed under her feet until she clung
to the wall for support.</p>

<p>“How could I? But she told me—” She broke
off in pitiable confusion, and Brant gave her the helping
hand of a question:</p>

<p>“What was it she told you? I have given you the
right to say anything you please to me now.”</p>

<p>She saw instantly that she must go on or leave
Isabel under an imputation too dreadful to be contemplated.
“She told me that—that she sent you
away.”</p>

<p>“Sent me away? But she didn’t send me away;
that couldn’t be, you know. It is all a mistake, Dorothy—an
awful mistake. It was not I whom she sent
away; it was Harry.”</p>

<p>“Harry!” said Dorothy faintly. “Oh, dear, what
have I done? Tell me one thing, please. Whom did
you meet the last evening you came to see us?”</p>

<p>It was Brant’s turn to be confused and tongue-tied,
and he answered her with his eyes on the floor.</p>

<p>“I met—your mother. I went over that evening
to tell you that—I—loved you, my darling; to tell you
what I had been, and what I hoped to be, and to ask
you to wait until I could make my promises good.
Your mother met me, and— But no matter about that.
It was she who sent me away—for good reasons, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
will say now. None the less, bad as I am, and good
as you are, I love you—you and no other, my dear
one; how truly and passionately you may know some
day.”</p>

<p>“Some day!” She knew at that sublime moment,
and the keen joy of the knowledge made her lose sight
of everything save the heart-quelling fact. “Thank
God, I know it now!—know that you are here in prison
because you thought it was the only way to save my
brother. Oh, how could I——”</p>

<p>“Be so faithless,” she would have said; but he
caught her in his arms and his kisses put the remorseful
exclamation to death.</p>

<p>“Say but two words, my darling,” he whispered.
“Tell me that you love me, and that you believe me
innocent of this last horrible thing, and I shall die
happier than most men live.”</p>

<p>But, after all, he had to take the first of the two
words for granted. His saying that he should die
happy brought her back to the peril of the moment.</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t say that! I know you are innocent;
but so is brother!”</p>

<p>He shook his head gravely and drew her closer. “I
wish I could believe that, but I can’t, Dorothy, dear,”
he said sorrowfully. “I should not have been weak
enough to betray him, even to you; but now you must
keep my secret and help me to save him. Try to think
of it as I have. You remember what the Man of Nazareth
said: ‘They that take the sword shall perish with
the sword.’ I have lived a life of violence, and it is
only just that I should pay the penalty.”</p>

<p>But her sense of right and wrong was keener and
truer than his. “No, you must not say that. Two
wrongs never make a right. Can’t you see that your
blood will be upon the head of the judge and the jury,
and every one who has anything to do with punishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
you for a crime you did not commit? Oh, you mustn’t,
you must not!”</p>

<p>“I have thought of all that, dear,” he said, “and at
times it has shaken me. But there is no other way. It
is my life or your brother’s. He is young; the lesson
will be a terrible one, and he may live to profit by it.”</p>

<p>His words carried such deep conviction of William’s
guilt that she gasped and gave a little cry of anguish.</p>

<p>“Oh, are you sure? Did you see him do it?”</p>

<p>“No, dear; it was done in the moment of darkness.
But when they turned the lights on from without he
had the pistol in his hand, and I saw him throw it upon
the floor. Will you tell me why they say he couldn’t
have done it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know well enough to make it clear; but
Harry and one of Mr. Forsyth’s young men made some
measurements, and they both say that the shot couldn’t
have been fired from where Will was sitting; that it
must have been fired from the direction of the door.”</p>

<p>“From the door?” A great desire to live and love
and be loved came quickly to Brant, and he made haste
to put it away before it should possess him. “I wish
I had known that sooner, but it is too late now. I
wasn’t near the door; I was trying to get between them
when the shot was fired.”</p>

<p>“It must not be too late!” cried Dorothy eagerly.
“Oh, why didn’t they tell you? Why——”</p>

<p>She broke off abruptly and struggled out of his arms
at the sound of a footstep in the corridor. It was the
turnkey coming to release her, and there was time for
no more than a breathless question.</p>

<p>“May I tell—” she began; and he bent over her till
his lips touched her forehead.</p>

<p>“I am yours in life or in death,” he said gently.
“Do with me what seems best to you, my darling.”</p>

<p>A moment later she had rejoined Antrim in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
corridor, but neither spoke until they were out of the
building. It was in the half-light between day and
dusk when they reached the street, and the chief clerk
curbed his impatience until they were hurrying to catch
the North Denver car. Then it slipped the leash.</p>

<p>“What luck?” he demanded, as they threaded the
crowded sidewalk in Larimer Street. “Did you find
out anything? Would he talk to you?”</p>

<p>Dorothy blushed hotly and drew down her veil.</p>

<p>“Ye-yes, he talked very freely, and I found out a
great many things. Wait till we get out of the crowd
and I will tell you.”</p>

<p>They missed the car, as a matter of course, and had
to wait on the street corner. Whereupon Antrim drew
his companion into a sheltered doorway and refused to
be kept longer in ignorance and suspense.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, tell me, Dorothy, what did he
say? I’m on tenter-hooks, and it seemed as if you
would never come out.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t do it, Harry. He is innocent,” she began
triumphantly, and Antrim could see her eyes shining
behind the veil.</p>

<p>“I have known that all along,” he interrupted impatiently.
“What then? What about the papers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I forgot all about them! I can’t talk
about it, Harry; not here in the street. But there is
one thing I must tell you”—the hot blush came again
and its attendant emotion threatened to stop her, but
she went on bravely—“it is about—Mr. Brant and—and
Isabel. I was just dreadfully, horridly, stupidly
mistaken. Isabel meant—that is, it’s not Mr. Brant;
it is somebody else. There is nothing at all between
them, and there never has been. I——”</p>

<p>Antrim waited to hear no more. There was an idle
carriage standing at the curb, and before she knew
what he meant to do he had put her into it, slammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
the door, and swung himself up to a seat beside the
driver.</p>

<p>“To Judge Langford’s house, over in the Highlands.
I’ll show you the way if you don’t know it,” he
said briefly; and then, “The quicker you make it
the more money you’ll earn.”</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time he was helping Dorothy
out at the Hollywood gate. “Fix it some way so that
I can have ten minutes alone with Isabel,” he begged
as they hurried up the walk, “and then I’ll be ready to
hear all about Brant. You will do that much for me,
won’t you, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>Fortunately, it needed not to be arranged. Isabel
met them in the hall, and Dorothy had but to dart
quickly into the library and so leave them alone together.
Two weeks of utter neglect had humbled Isabel
rather more than she would admit even to herself,
but they had also made her affectionately vindictive.
Hence she gave him no more than a cool little “Good
evening, Harry. Won’t you come in?”</p>

<p>“I am in; and I’ll stay to dinner if you will ask
me,” he retorted promptly, penning her into the corner
between the door and the stairfoot. “But first I want
to say something that I am going to repeat every time
we meet, regardless of time, place, or present company.
I love you, Isabel, I have always loved you, and I am always
going to.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Isabel with sweet sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Yes, in deed, and in thought, and in word. More
than that, I know now that you love me—oh, don’t take
the trouble to deny it; it’s wrong to tell fibs. You told
Dorothy you did, and she gave it away without meaning
to. So you see it is no use, and you may as well give
me that kiss I asked for the last time you told me the
biggest fib of all the——”</p>

<p>“Not now—or ever!” she retorted, slipping under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
his arm and darting down the hall to the drawing-room
door. He caught at her as she eluded him, and then
ran after her. She paused with her hand on the doorknob.</p>

<p>“Keep your distance, or I vanish!” she threatened.
“Stand right there where you are and tell me why you
went off in a dudgeon that night; and why you froze
me out two weeks ago; and why you haven’t been back
since; and why——”</p>

<p>But the catechism was never finished. With a most
lamentable want of vigilance she took her hand from
the doorknob, and Antrim— But sufficient unto the
day of youth are the small triumphs thereof.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Kate Hobart, coming down
to dinner, stumbled over two young persons sitting on
the lowest step of the stair. She recognised them even
in the darkness, and being but a Sabbath-day’s journey
beyond her own love affair, understood at once why the
hall was not yet lighted.</p>

<p>Antrim sprang quickly to his feet and made the explanation
which does not explain; and Kate benevolently
helped him out by asking if there were anything
new in Brant’s affair.</p>

<p>“No—yes, there is, too, by Jove! And we have
been sitting here talking—that is, ah—er——”</p>

<p>“Spooning, Harry, dear,” cut in Isabel with refreshing
frankness; “tell the truth and shame——”</p>

<p>But he went on without a break—“while Dorothy is
waiting to tell us about Brant. Let’s go in and hear
her story.”</p>

<p>Isabel tapped at the library door, and they all saw
within when the judge opened to her. Dorothy was
sitting on the lounge, her hat and gloves still on, her
face pale and tear-stained. The judge waved them
back.</p>

<p>“In a moment,” he said; and then he crossed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
room to bend over the still little figure on the lounge
and to whisper a word of encouragement.</p>

<p>“It is hard to win and lose in the same moment,
but you must be brave, my child—for your own sake
and mine. I shall keep your secret; your mother
mustn’t suspect—now or ever.”</p>

<p>She nodded, and the tears came afresh.</p>

<p>“Go you up to your room,” he added, seeing that
there was no present balm for the hurt. “I’ll make
your excuses at the table.”</p>

<p>Then he joined the trio in the hall. “Dorothy
brought astounding news,” he explained, leading the
way to the dining room, “but it comes too late. From
what she tells me there seems to be a reasonable doubt
of the young man’s guilt; but there is nothing that can
be used in evidence, and his conviction is none the less
certain.”</p>

<p>There was manifestly nothing to be said, and a sympathetic
silence followed the announcement. While
they were taking their places at table the telephone
rang, and the judge excused himself to answer it.</p>

<p>“Don’t wait on me,” he said. “Harry, lad, take my
place and carve, will you?” and he went out and carefully
closed the door behind him. And inasmuch as
the hall was not yet lighted, he failed to see a shadowy
little figure on the stair. It was Dorothy, and she
paused and leaned over the balustrade when her father
answered the call.</p>

<small>SUCH FRIENDS ARE EXULTATION’S AGONY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Arrah</span>, now, Misther Jarvis, ’tis no use your flatthering
me the like of that. Fwhat I know, I know;
and that I’ll keep to myself. Besides, wasn’t it Misther
Brant himself, poor dear! that says, says he,
‘Mum’s the wurrud, Mary, me jool; sure ’tis but a b’y’s
thrick, and I’ll not be having it talked about at all
at all.’”</p>

<p>“Yes; but that was before it all came out in the
newspapers,” Jarvis cut in glibly. “He doesn’t mind
your talking about it now; in fact, he told me to ask
you.”</p>

<p>For something better than a week the reporter had
been assiduously cultivating Mrs. Seeley’s housemaid,
and one of the results of the intimacy was a second visit
to Brant’s room, made in the landlady’s absence and
connived at and arranged by Mary McCarthy. Jarvis
hoped little from a second inspection of the room, and
not much from anything the housemaid could tell.
Yet he lied brazenly to make her talk, and the lie accomplished
that whereunto it was sent.</p>

<p>“Ah, then, did he tell you that, poor man?” said
the unsuspecting Mary.</p>

<p>“He did, for a fact; couldn’t come himself, you
know, poor fellow!” rejoined the reporter, clinching
the falsehood promptly. “Now show me just what
you did and tell me what you saw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>Thus absolved and adjured, Mary McCarthy went
circumstantially over the account of her discovery of
the burglar, Jarvis absorbing the story as it was told,
and leaving the journalistic compartment of his brain
to sift the salient facts from the mass of embellishment
and exaggeration.</p>

<p>“Black clothes, you say?” he interrupted, when
the housemaid came to the describing of the intruder.</p>

<p>“Black as Father Callahan’s cassock.”</p>

<p>“Then he didn’t look like a tramp or a tough?”</p>

<p>“On’y for the oogly face av him I might have mistook
him for Misther Brant himself.”</p>

<p>Jarvis strolled to the window and stood with his
hands deep in his pockets, looking out upon the tin
roof of the porch.</p>

<p>“Dang the thing!” he muttered. “It gets blinder
with every move. Now, who the mischief is this gentleman
burglar whom Brant wants to screen, and what
was he here for? By Jove! I wonder if it was young
Langford? He always wears gamblers’ mourning.
But what the dickens was he trying to steal?”</p>

<p>He turned away from the window and made another
slow circuit of the room in the vague hope that he
might stumble upon some overlooked clew to the puzzle.
There was none, and he was about to give it up
when he came to the closet at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>“Does this door open into the next room?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No, sure; ’tis on’y the closet where Misther Brant
does be keeping his clothes.”</p>

<p>Jarvis turned the knob and glanced at the garments
hanging in an orderly row at the back of the shallow
recess. “These are all Brant’s, I suppose,” he said
carelessly.</p>

<p>“’Deed and they are, then. Whose else would they
be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Are these all he has?”</p>

<p>Mary McCarthy picked a fancied suspicion out of
the meaningless question and promptly resented it.</p>

<p>“D’ye think annybody would be shtealing them?”
she demanded. “Av coorse they are all there, barring
fwhat Misther Antrim and the b’y tuk to him at the
jail.”</p>

<p>“Boy? What boy was this?”</p>

<p>“’Deed, then, I don’t know; some little scaramouch
from the sthreets, I’m thinking. But he did be bringing
a letther from Misther Brant; ’tis there on the
table.”</p>

<p>Jarvis sauntered across the room and took a dirty
scrap of paper from beneath a paperweight on the small
writing table. It was a misspelled pencil scrawl,
signed with Brant’s name, but he did not have to look
twice to decide that it was the clumsiest of forgeries,
written evidently by some one who had never so much
as seen Brant’s handwriting.</p>

<p>“Mary, dear,” he said feelingly, “you are a pearl
of price, and the mate to you has never been found.”</p>

<p>“Be off wid you wid your flatthering tongue!”</p>

<p>“It’s not flattery—never a word of it. Did Mrs.
Seeley see this letter?”</p>

<p>“Sure, she did that same. ’Twas to her that the
b’y did be giving it.”</p>

<p>“And she gave the boy the suit of clothes it calls
for?”</p>

<p>“Av coorse she did. And ’tis myself as was wondering
fwhat Misther Brant would be wanting wid
them ould rags.”</p>

<p>“From all our friends—so they be women—good
Lord deliver us!” said Jarvis under his breath; then
aloud: “That was quite right, of course. Did you
happen to see the clothes yourself, Mary?”</p>

<p>“I did that; an ould dirty suit of pepper-and-salt it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
was, the likes of fwhat Misther Brant never did be
wearing in the whole swate life av him.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>Jarvis slipped the note into his pocket and got away
as quickly as he could. It was but the slenderest
thread of a clew, but it spanned one of the many gaps
he had been vainly trying for a fortnight to bridge.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of his investigation the reporter
had stumbled upon Harding’s disguise—the wig
and the false beard—in the West Denver <i>Gasthaus</i>; and
a painstaking inquiry into the habits of the red-haired
and fiery-bearded lodger had developed the fact that he
was seen often in company with another man whose
description Jarvis had gathered from many sources, but
whom he was as yet unable to identify.</p>

<p>So far as could be ascertained, the unidentified one
had disappeared on the night of the tragedy. He had
been seen alone at Draco’s in the earlier hours of that
night, and he had not been seen by any of Jarvis’s informants
since that time. Apart from the overheard
conference in Heddrigg’s restaurant—a conference in
which Jarvis had long since recognised Harding in his
character of red-beard and the unknown man as the two
participants—there was nothing to remotely connect
the unidentified man with Brant’s affair; nothing, unless
the forged letter to Mrs. Seeley might be taken as a
connecting link. But just here the reporter’s incomplete
knowledge of the facts hampered him. He knew
nothing of the papers at which the burglary pointed,
and could only guess from the overheard conversation
in Heddrigg’s restaurant that the burglar was an emissary
of Harding’s. At the finding of the forged letter he
had jumped to the conclusion that the house-breaker and
Harding’s unknown companion were one and the same
person; but cooler after-thought brought doubt, and a
leaning toward the William Langford hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“I am afraid it was the young fellow, after all,”
he said at the summing up. “That guess fits the other
guesses a little more as if it belonged. Nobody but a
fool of a boy would do such a thing and get stone blind
in the middle of it; and there is nobody else in the
whole shooting match that Brant would go out of his
way to shield. As for the clothes and the letter, they
don’t count very hard. Even as big a fool as the boy
would have sense enough not to wear his everyday
clothes while he burgled a house.”</p>

<p>So Jarvis concluded; and he did not change his
mind when, later in the day, in another talk with Deverney,
he learned that Harding’s unknown companion
had always appeared in dingy “pepper-and-salt.”
That was a mere coincidence, he argued; and the pattern
was certainly common enough to warrant the
supposition.</p>

<p>It was in the evening of this same day that the reporter
asked his chief to procure him an order to visit
the prisoner, or, rather, asked if such an order could
be procured.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the night editor. “It’s after
hours. But we can try. What have you stumbled
upon—anything new?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. Write me the request for an
order, and I’ll tell you about it when I come back. I
have an idea.”</p>

<p>The request was written and Jarvis forthfared to
the jail. His idea was but the piecing together of
some irrelevant facts. He had learned from his chief
that Brant had at one time taken a pistol from Harding,
and from the editor’s description the weapon was a <i>facsimile</i>
of the one found on the floor of the card room
after the murder. Out of this the reporter built a new
theory, and an interview with Brant was needed to confirm
or disprove it.</p>

<small>TE MORITURI SALUTAMUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> it was late in the day when Jarvis left the Plainsman
building armed with his chief’s request for an order
to visit the prisoner in the jail, it was still later
when the formalities were finally appeased and he
gained access to the inner fastnesses of the city’s house
of detention and to Brant’s cell.</p>

<p>Having but now parted from Dorothy, Brant was in
the seventh heaven of love’s aftermath when the cell
door opened to admit the reporter; and since love
breaks ground for far-reaching kindliness, the news-gatherer’s
welcome was all that could be desired.</p>

<p>“I wonder if any unlucky dog of them all ever had
better friends or more of them than I have, Jarvis?
The way you all stand by me would warm the cockles
of a worse heart than mine ever was.” Thus the prisoner
of good hope, love-tempered; and Jarvis laughed.</p>

<p>“You don’t deserve to have any friends. May I sit
on your bed? Thanks. A fellow that loses the combination
on his tongue the way you have ought to be
hanged on general principles. But you’ve got to talk
to me, or thrash me, one of the two.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do both, if you insist,” said Brant with cheerful
levity. “Which will you have first?”</p>

<p>“The answers to two or three questions first, and
then, if there is any fight left in you, we’ll see about the
thrashing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“Go ahead. What is it you want to know?” said
the aforetime bondsman of reticence.</p>

<p>“A lot of things that you can’t tell me, and some
few that you can. Did you at one time have a gun—a
Colt’s forty-five—that had once belonged to Harding?”</p>

<p>Brant lost levity and freedom of speech in the dropping
of an eyelid, but he could not in common fairness
refuse to answer.</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Did you have this admirable weapon about you on
the night of the shooting?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where was it at that time?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I think I do know,” said the cross-examiner placidly.
“You had lost it, hadn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. Now I am going to hazard a guess—dang
the thing! it’s all guesses, so far—and I shall
know if I’ve hit it whether you admit it or not. You
left that gun in your room the night of the burglary,
and you haven’t seen it since.”</p>

<p>Brant did not attempt to deny it. “That is also
true,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“So far, so good. Now, do you know who it was
who broke into your room, and slept in your bed, and
stole your artillery?”</p>

<p>“I think I do, but I don’t care to discuss that point
with you.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t, if you don’t want to. But it will be
discussed in open court next week.”</p>

<p>Brant’s start was not lost upon the young man, who
had apparently missed his vocation in electing to be a
journalist rather than a detective.</p>

<p>“Why should it come up at the trial?” Brant demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“Because it is going to have a very considerable
bearing on the case,” said Jarvis coolly. “The man
who took the pistol from your room gave it back to
Harding.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he did?”</p>

<p>Jarvis leered. “He did, or he didn’t; one of the
two. I believe he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“More theories,” said Brant, not without sarcasm.
“What difference does it make?”</p>

<p>“It makes all the difference in the world when you
come to tie it to the fact that Harding was killed with
that same weapon.”</p>

<p>This time Brant’s start was visible to the naked eye
of the least critical observer, but his rejoinder was well
measured and calm:</p>

<p>“What is your theory? Set it in words.”</p>

<p>Jarvis settled himself on the cot, nursing one knee
in his clasped hands and chewing an extinct cigar.
“It’s as simple as twice two. You heard young Langford’s
testimony at the preliminary examination?”</p>

<p>“Naturally, being within a few feet of him when
he gave it.”</p>

<p>“Very good. You were in that card room at the
Osirian and saw what he saw. Did he tell the truth?”</p>

<p>Brant was silent.</p>

<p>“You know he didn’t tell the truth; or, at least,
he didn’t tell all of it,” Jarvis went on. “He said that
Harding drew a pistol on him, but he did not say that
he had already drawn his own. Also, he left the inference
wide open that the big pistol on the table, the pistol
from which the shot was fired, was Harding’s—that
Harding had laid it there. That wasn’t so.”</p>

<p>Brant sprang to his feet in a frenzy of impatience.
“For God’s sake, have done with this beating about the
bush and tell me what you know or what you suspect!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>Jarvis complied in set phrase. “This: Young
Langford was the man who broke into your room. He
was the man who took the pistol, who carried it all the
next day, who drew it upon Harding, who—” He broke
off abruptly, leaving the categorical accusation unfinished.
“You know what happened just as well as I do.
It was that young cub who did the shooting, and you
are here because—well, I know the why and wherefore
of that, too, but we needn’t go into it. You’ve been
all sorts of a Don Quixote, and I believe you’d keep it
up to the finish, if you had your way. But it won’t go,
George.”</p>

<p>Brant said nothing. He was leaning against the
wall, just where Dorothy had stood a little while before,
and there was a far-away look in his eyes—the look that
comes into the eyes of a soldier when duty calls and
death beckons. But Jarvis was not skilled in reading
face signs, and he went on, secure in the worldly wisdom
of his own point of view.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying it wasn’t a fine thing. If you had
lived two or three centuries ago they would have drawn
and quartered you first and made a demigod of you
afterward. But it won’t go now. When people find
out, half of them will laugh at you, and the other half
will say you ought to be sent to a lunatic asylum. If
you could have carried it through——”</p>

<p>Brant came out of his reverie and sat down on the
cot beside the exponent of worldly wisdom.</p>

<p>“You say, if I could have carried it through,” he
broke in. “But now?”</p>

<p>“Now there is nothing to do but to switch over and
pull in harness with common sense. It will all come
out at the trial—it’s bound to. The judge is making
believe that he is going to be your counsel, whether or
no; but you know you are not going to allow it, and the
upshot of that will be that the court will appoint somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
else to defend you, and it is ten to one that it will
be some keen young fellow with nothing to lose and
everything to gain. There are a dozen young lawyers
keeping up with the case, and any one of them will
snap at the chance. And you know as well as I do
what will happen if any lawyer in the wide world, save
and excepting his own father, gets a chance to cross-examine
Will Langford.”</p>

<p>Brant nodded, as one who may not controvert a self-evident
fact. But what he said brought the reporter’s
card house of hypotheses tumbling in ruins.</p>

<p>“You have made your case, Jarvis, and summed it
up, but there is one small flaw in it. You are taking it
for granted that young Langford killed Harding, and
that I did not. What if I say that your basic premises
are wrong?”</p>

<p>Jarvis laughed, but it was not the laugh of assurance.
“You can’t bluff me out, George; I know what
I know.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything. You are merely guessing
from beginning to end.”</p>

<p>Jarvis took time to think about it, and assurance
slipped still farther into the abyss of incertitude.</p>

<p>“If it is only a guess, you can make it a certainty,”
he said at length.</p>

<p>Brant smiled. “You would hardly expect me to tie
the rope around my own neck, even in a confidential
talk with you. But I will tell you a little, and you may
infer the rest—you are pretty good at inferences. My
quarrel with Harding was of the deadly sort, and it
had been going on for years. A few weeks ago I ran
him out of town, telling him plainly that if he came
back I should kill him. After he had gone I learned
that he had done a thing for which there was no such
word as forgiveness, and I swore then, and wrote it
down in a letter, that his chance for life lay in keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
out of my way. Can you put two and two together?”</p>

<p>Jarvis nodded slowly. “You’ve buried me and
my little theory six feet deep, with a stone atop, and—and
I’m honestly sorry. I couldn’t believe you’d do a
thing like that in cold blood, George.”</p>

<p>“Do you call it cold blood? There were three of
us in that eight-by-ten shambles that night, and somebody
had to die.”</p>

<p>The turnkey was unlocking the door, and Jarvis
rose.</p>

<p>“I guess there isn’t anything more to say,” he said.
“Can I do anything for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you may take a line to Forsyth for me, if you
will.” And then to the jailer: “One minute, Carson,
until I write a note.”</p>

<p>The note was written, and Jarvis took his leave,
wringing Brant’s hand at parting quite as heartily as
he would if the card house of guesses had not been
wrecked.</p>

<p>“You’ve simply made another friend, old man,”
he whispered. “It was mostly curiosity with me before,
but now I’ll stand by you while the lamp holds out
to burn.”</p>

<p>Brant returned the hand grip, but his smile had in
it more than gratitude. “I’ll let you know when you
can do anything,” he promised; and then the iron door
came between.</p>

<p>The reporter found his chief waiting impatiently
for his return, and Forsyth was soon acquainted not
only with Jarvis’s guesses, but with the main points in
the late interview.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” said Jarvis in conclusion, “except
that he gave me this note for you.”</p>

<p>Forsyth read the note and swore gratefully.</p>

<p>“You are to be congratulated, Jarvis; you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
done what none of the rest of us have been able to do.
He consents to accept Judge Langford as his counsel.”
And the editor went quickly to the telephone to call up
the house in the Highlands.</p>

<p>This was the skirling of the bell which had interrupted
the master of Hollywood as he was sitting down
to his dinner, and which had made Dorothy linger on
the stair to hear what should come of it.</p>

<p>“What is it, papa?” she asked, when her father replaced
the earpiece in its hook.</p>

<p>“It is a message from Mr. Forsyth. Brant has
notified him that he will accept me as his counsel, and
has promised not to obstruct us any more. You may
take that for a grain of comfort.”</p>

<p>But Dorothy still lingered. “Is the time set for
the trial, papa?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Tuesday of next week. But don’t grieve
till you must. We shall be ready, and we shall do all
there is to be done.”</p>

<p>“One week from to-day—one little week!” She
said it over and over to herself in the darkness after her
father had gone back to the dining room, and the grain
of comfort was swallowed up in foreboding.</p>

<p>The week of waiting was outworn at length, slowly
for the State’s attorneys, since their case was already
made, but all too swiftly for Brant’s friends. At the
end of it Judge Langford went into court with as little
of weight to say for his client as any advocate of a man
who was already tried and found guilty by public opinion
could have. Of that little he made the best possible
use, and his eloquent plea to the jury had in it all the
fire and fervour and pathos of a strong man who had
once been the ablest special pleader in a section where
eloquence is in some sort a birthright.</p>

<p>But the judge fought a losing battle from the beginning;
he knew it, and all the others knew it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
Though the prisoner had receded from his original determination,
and had pleaded “Not guilty,” the plea
was taken to be wholly a matter of form. His guilt was
tacitly admitted by all, and the judge’s appeal was for
clemency rather than for acquittal. “<i>If</i> this man had
done this thing,” was the preface to each fresh outburst
of eloquent beseeching.</p>

<p>None the less the effort proved unavailing. Forsyth
had prophesied truly. Public sentiment was aroused,
and there was need enough for a stern example on the
side of strict justice. Brant’s friends saw all this
written out large in the faces of the jury, and were
prepared for the verdict. As a mere matter of decent
formality the twelve men left the jury box at the
close of the judge’s charge to them; but they were
back again before the hum of comment in the crowded
courtroom was fairly a-buzz. And in the silence
which fell upon all the foreman announced the verdict.
The prisoner at the bar had been found guilty
as charged.</p>

<p>There was a little hush, the electrified stillness
which precedes a death sentence in any court, and then
Judge Langford rose to give notice that an appeal
would be taken. The court heard him through patiently,
and sentence was suspended accordingly. Then
the prisoner was remanded to jail, and the trial was
over.</p>

<p>Judge Langford had no hope of securing a new
trial, and he admitted as much when Forsyth got speech
with him. “It was the only thing there was left for us
to do,” he said, “and we shall gain nothing by it save
a little delay. But having undertaken to plough this
young man’s furrow, I shall plough it faithfully to the
end.”</p>

<p>Once more, as on a former occasion, the judge’s
forecasting was rooted in the event. The motion for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
a retrial was argued, heard, and denied; the prisoner
was sentenced, and the day of execution was set for the
Friday before Thanksgiving. And at the pronouncing
of the sentence that Friday was no more than a fortnight
in the future.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV<br>

<small>THE WING-BEAT OF AZRAEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> Dorothy? Truly, these were terrible days and
weeks for one who loved, and had lost and found, only
to lose again. But, believing in her lover’s innocence
as no one else save Henry Antrim did believe in it, she
was yet powerless to break a single thread of the net
which enmeshed him. She could do naught but
grieve despairingly, and that in secret, since none but
her father and Antrim guessed the depth of her hurt.</p>

<p>To her in her misery came an angel of light masquerading
as one Parker Jarvis. She knew the reporter
by sight, and better by repute, since Antrim had
spoken much of him and of his friendly movings in
Brant’s affair. She also knew that he was of those who
would have held Brant excused though guilty; but at
this point her knowledge of him paused until, one black
Thursday evening in late November, but a single sweep
of the clock hands from the fatal Friday morning, when
she had stolen out of the house to be alone with her
misery, he stood uncovered before her holding the gate
for her to pass out.</p>

<p>“Do you know who I am, Miss Langford?” he
asked; and when she signed assent he turned and
walked beside her.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to intrude, and I could have only one
excuse for waylaying you,” he went on. “If there is
any blame, Harry Antrim must answer for it. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
doesn’t mean to tell all the things he knows, but
sometimes he tells a good bit more than he sets out
to, and he has told me enough to make me understand
why to-morrow will hurt you worse than it will any
of us.”</p>

<p>There was manifestly no answer to be made to this,
and she let him go on without hindrance. For to-morrow
would end it all, and anything less than death
seemed too trivial to be opposed.</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask you to help me at a pinch where I
am unable to help myself,” he continued. “But before
I come to the helping part, I’d like to tell you just
where I stand to-night. May I do that?”</p>

<p>Her “Yes” was no more than a whisper, but he
heard it and took his cue promptly, beginning in the
midst.</p>

<p>“At first I thought Brant did it, as a matter of
course. Everything pointed that way, and the mere
fact of his giving himself up seemed as good as a confession.
But afterward when I began to dig a little
deeper into it I wasn’t so sure; in fact, I came to believe
that your brother had done it, and that Brant was
trying to screen him—to—well, to stand in the way
until your brother had a chance to run for it. You
mustn’t mind my saying these things, because they
have to be said before I can come around to the present
state of affairs.”</p>

<p>Again she gave him liberty. “It does not matter;
nothing matters any more.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Well, about that time I had a talk with
Brant, and I’m ashamed to say he made me fly the track
again—made me believe he did do it, after all; and I
went on believing it till one day about a week ago, when
Harry Antrim told me what you told him Brant had
told you. That is pretty badly tangled up, but I guess
you know what I am driving at.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“Mr. Brant told me he was innocent—is that what
you mean?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That’s it precisely, and I just put it up that he
would come pretty near telling you the truth; that you
are the one person in the world he wouldn’t lie to. So
I had to climb over the fence again, and—well, to cut
a long story short, I haven’t had ten hours’ sleep in the
last sixty-odd; and—and to-morrow is the day.”</p>

<p>She caught despairingly at the straw, as any poor
drowning one might. “O Mr. Jarvis, what have you
done? what can be done?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I have done anything. I’ve
been desperately tangled up in two theories, and one
of them is no good unless I can get rid of the other.
Miss Langford, you will know how hard pressed I am
when you hear what I came over here to ask you, but
you must let to-morrow be my excuse for anything and
everything. You have seen your brother and have
been with him more or less every day since this thing
happened: is he the one who ought to be counting the
hours as George Brant is probably counting them this
evening?”</p>

<p>The early dusk of the winter day was beginning to
prick out the arc lights in the downtown circuits, and
she stopped to turn back; and so facing him she gave
him his answer:</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Jarvis, my brother did not do it. I have
thought of that—I have been driven to think of it,
dreadful as it is; and I have watched him—God forgive
me!—I have watched him as an enemy might. <i>He did
not do it!</i>”</p>

<p>Jarvis threw up his head and drew a deep breath
of the crisp night air, as a swimmer who feels the bottom
under his feet while yet the shore of ultimate safety
is afar off.</p>

<p>“That helps out a whole lot,” he said; and his involuntary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
sigh was a measure of the relief which her
assurance gave him. “May I walk back with you?
I’m not half through.”</p>

<p>She suffered him, and he went quickly forward in
the path she had cleared for him.</p>

<p>“We are now a long way ahead of any point that
has been reached hitherto,” he began. “Brant didn’t
do it, and your brother didn’t do it. But a man was
killed, and if he did not commit suicide, somebody must
have killed him. Happily, we don’t have to wrangle
with the suicide theory, so we may safely fall back on
the alternative. Do you follow me?”</p>

<p>Her “Yes” was not a whisper this time; it was an
eager little gasp of expectancy.</p>

<p>“Good. Now, while I have been holding the William
Langford possibility in suspension, as it were, I
have been filling in the time by hunting desperately for
this shadowy ‘somebody.’ That is why I haven’t had
much sleep since Monday night.”</p>

<p>“O Mr. Jarvis! Have you found any clew at
all?”</p>

<p>“If I say Yes, you must understand that it isn’t any
bigger than a spider’s web—just one strand of a spider’s
web, at that. For a week or so before the shooting
Harding was seen here and there and everywhere in
company with a man whom everybody can describe
after a fashion and nobody can identify. They seemed
to be friends, but that doesn’t count for much among
people of that kind. Still, there is only one little thing
to connect this unknown man with the murder, so
far.”</p>

<p>“And that is?”</p>

<p>“That is the fact that he was seen just before the
shooting, and he has not been seen since.”</p>

<p>“But surely he can be found?” So much she said,
and then she covered her face with her hands and a dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
sob shook her. In a few short hours the clearest proof
of Brant’s innocence would come too late.</p>

<p>Jarvis understood, and he held his peace until she
grew calmer. Then he said: “I’ve told you my errand,
or at least the biggest part of it. But there is one other
little thing in which you can help. The time has come
for the forlorn hope to make its last dash. Antrim
tells me that Mr. Hobart, Brant’s oldest friend, has just
got word, and he is coming hotfoot to Denver on this
evening’s train. I want to have a final rally of Brant’s
friends at Forsyth’s office to-night to see if we can’t
cook up some sort of an excuse to beg the Governor for
a reprieve. It’s the only hope now.”</p>

<p>“But I—how can I help?” she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“You can persuade your father to come down after
dinner. Harry will call for him with a carriage.”</p>

<p>She did not reply at once, and when she spoke it was
as one who feels the way. “Will you understand me if
I say that my father thinks he has done his whole duty?
You must remember that he believes firmly in Mr.
Brant’s guilt—he has believed in it from the very
first.”</p>

<p>“I know; but it must be your share in this last
pull to make him believe as we do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how can I?” she cried.</p>

<p>“I think I can put you in the way of doing it, but
you must forgive me if I dig still deeper into a matter
which is your own private affair, Miss Langford. You
have had one interview with Brant since he was locked
up, and any man with blood in his veins could guess
what happened in that half hour you were together.
I’m not going to ask you to repeat that talk for my
benefit, but I do ask this: Didn’t Brant give you to
understand that he believed your brother to be the
guilty one?”</p>

<p>She was choking with mingled grief and humiliation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
and embarrassment, but she made shift to answer
him:</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“Then, of course, you knew at once why he was
there; that he had stepped in voluntarily to save your
brother—not for Will’s sake, perhaps, but for yours?”</p>

<p>“I knew it then—I know it now.”</p>

<p>“And you knew that, rather than let the shame and
disgrace and horror come upon you and yours, he would
keep it up to the bitter end—that end which is coming
to him to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I knew that, too.”</p>

<p>Jarvis paused, and then he clinched the nail he had
driven:</p>

<p>“Have you ever tried to make your father understand
all this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are hard—bitter hard!” she broke out
passionately. “I did try at first, but my father said it
wasn’t in human nature. And how could I hope to
make him believe it when he was so thoroughly convinced
of Mr. Brant’s guilt?”</p>

<p>“None the less, you have it to do. You must convince
him, and persuade him to come down to the
office with Harry to-night. Luckily, I can help you a
little. It so happened that I went to see Brant the
same day you saw him. I was with him in less than
half an hour after you left him. In that talk I came
within one word of making him admit to me that he
wasn’t guilty, and also of making him confess that he
believed Will did the shooting. Shall I tell you how
I know this?”</p>

<p>“If you must—if you will.”</p>

<p>“I had told him that it wasn’t any use to try to
keep up the fiction; that the truth would all come out
at the trial; that the court would appoint a lawyer to
defend him, and that any counsel he might have, save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
and excepting only your father, would break your brother’s
testimony down in five minutes. Do you know
what he did when I told him this?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He sat down and scribbled a note for me to take to
Forsyth. In that note he told Forsyth that he had reconsidered;
that he would accept your father as his
counsel. He believed it was the only way to save your
brother from a cross-examination which would undo
what he was staking his life to do. That is all.”</p>

<p>They had reached the Hollywood gate, and he
opened it for her, and when she stood beyond it, lifted
his hat.</p>

<p>“I hope I haven’t said too much, or asked too much,
Miss Langford.”</p>

<p>She came close to the gate, and he could see her
eyes shining in the twilight.</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t said too much, and you haven’t
asked too much. I shall go down on my knees to my
father, Mr. Jarvis, and—and as God helps me, he shall
go to you believing as we do. And for yourself—”
But he was gone before she could thank him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV<br>

<small>THE WISDOM OF MANY AND THE WIT OF ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was quite dark when the reporter left the Langford
gate and set out at a rapid walk toward the nearest
street-car corner. As he was turning out of Altamont
Terrace a four-wheeler with two men on the box swung
into the curving street of the suburb from the boulevard.
Jarvis gave a shrill whistle, and the carriage
drew up at the curb.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Jarvis?” said Antrim, from his seat
beside the driver.</p>

<p>“Yes. You’re ’way too early; they haven’t been to
dinner yet.”</p>

<p>“Did you see her?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Can she do it?”</p>

<p>“She knows she’s got to do it.”</p>

<p>“Good enough; I’ll go on up to the house and help
her.”</p>

<p>Jarvis reached up, felt in Antrim’s vest pocket,
found a cigar, and coolly purloined it. “Begging your
pardon, you will do nothing of the kind, <i>savez vous</i>?
That little battle is one she will have to fight for herself.
You go away and kill time for an hour and then
come back.”</p>

<p>Antrim held his watch down so that the flare of
Jarvis’s match lighted the face of it.</p>

<p>“Six-thirty—seven-thirty. The train Hobart is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
coming on is late, and I’ll time things so we can go by
the station and pick him up. That gives me a clear
hour to spare. Get in, and we’ll take you back to
town.”</p>

<p>The reporter took his place in the empty four-wheeler
and rode cityward in solitary state, rode as far
as the Union Depot, and then got out to walk uptown.
Recalling the incidents of that eventful night, he could
never quite account for the impulse which led him to
drift aside from the straight course to the Plainsman
building, to turn the corner at Blake Street, and finally
to stroll aimlessly into Draco’s. At that early hour the
place was all but deserted, and Tom Deverney was glad
enough to have some one to talk to. As a matter of
course, he reverted to the impending fate of the one
known to both.</p>

<p>“Poor old George!” he said in rough sympathy.
“To-morrow morning winds him up, doesn’t it? By
cripes, if the old town was what it used to be, they’d
have to call out the soldiers before they could hang
him!”</p>

<p>But Jarvis would not speak of Brant.</p>

<p>“Tell me once more, Tom, about that fellow who
was running with the Professor—about how he looked,
I mean.”</p>

<p>“Still a-twanging on that old string?” laughed the
bartender. “I have told you till I can’t remember
how he looked myself.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; dig it over once more,” begged Jarvis
“It’s the last time I’ll ever bother you about
him.” And thus besought, Deverney racked his memory
and described the unknown man for the twentieth
time.</p>

<p>“Old clothes—always the same old clothes,” Jarvis
groaned in despair. “Didn’t he ever change them,
I wonder?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“Not that anybody ever saw or heard of. I—” The
bartender stopped short and knitted his brows till they
met above his eyes. “Say, I told you he was in here
to get a drink the night of the killing, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’d changed ’em that night, for once—gone
into mourning. I recollect, because I joshed him about
the misfit; asked him which one of his uncles had died
and left him the blacks.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“It’s a fact. Didn’t I tell you that before?”</p>

<p>“No.” Jarvis grew suddenly cool and wary.
“That is, I don’t remember it if you did. Now, cudgel
your brain once more, Tom, and try to guess me at
about what hour that was.”</p>

<p>“It just so happens that I can tell you to a dot. A
minute or two after ‘his Blacks’ was in here a fellow
came up from the faro game and wanted twenty-five
cases on his watch. I let him have ’em, and when I
went to put the ticker in the safe I noticed the time.
It was half past eleven.”</p>

<p>Jarvis bought a bad cigar, but he did not light it.
On the contrary, he was absently crushing the little
roll of alleged tobacco in his hand as he went out and
up the street. And a little later, when he was crossing
Larimer Street on his way to the rendezvous, he was
still scattering the powdered cabbage leaves in a thin
trail of brown dust behind him as he strode along.</p>

<p>“It is a sheer miracle—nothing less!” he muttered.
“Tom Deverney has told me that story more
than a dozen times before, and he left out the whole
heart of it every time until to-night. That knocks out
one of the mysteries with a good clean body blow. It
wasn’t young Langford who ransacked Brant’s room; it
was ‘his Blacks,’ as Deverney calls him. And if he was
drunk when he did it, he was sober enough when he sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
the boy for the cast-off pepper-and-salts that might have
betrayed him. Lord of love! if I only knew what he
was after!”</p>

<p>Like a flash of inspiration the answer tripped upon
the heels of the question. Antrim had told the reporter
about the packet of papers given him by Brant for
safe-keeping, but not until this instant had Jarvis been
able to put two and two together.</p>

<p>“That’s it—that is the whole thing in a nutshell!”
he ejaculated. “This fellow and Harding were partners
and Harding put him up to steal those papers.
Lord, Lord, what a flock of purblind bats we’ve been!”</p>

<p>But the night of miracles was yet young. When
the reporter had crossed the street, narrowly escaping
the wire scoop net of a passing cable car in his abstraction,
he stumbled upon one of the employees of the
Osirian Club, the doorkeeper who had been on duty
in the upper corridor on the night of the tragedy. Jarvis
stopped to buttonhole the man from sheer force of
reportorial habit.</p>

<p>“Hello, Binkie! Going on watch?” he queried.</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>“One demnition grind, isn’t it? Anything new?”</p>

<p>“No. Business has been mighty quiet with us
since that scrap in Number Seven.”</p>

<p>“Go shy, do they? That will wear off in time. By
the way, Binkie, there wasn’t anybody else in the big
room that night when George Brant went in, was
there?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul.” The man shifted uneasily from one
foot to the other, and then added, as one who seeks to
divide a harassing burden: “That’s what I told the police,
and it’s what I say now. But for all that, there
was a blamed queer thing happened that I haven’t told
anybody, and I’ve sweat about it till I’m galded raw.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” Jarvis forced himself to ask the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
question carelessly, but anxiety and eagerness were
fairly suffocating him.</p>

<p>“Why, it was this: George came up and asked me
about those two fellows, and which room they were in,
and I told him. Then I saw him go swinging up the
middle of the big room with that get-out-of-my-road
gait of his as plain as I see you now. Well, about two
minutes afterward I got up to go and close a window in
the far end of the hall, and when I got back to my chair
at the door there he was yet, still going up the room
the same as I’d seen him before. Blame me, if I didn’t
think I’d got ’em again, for a minute!”</p>

<p>“You are sure it was Brant?” said Jarvis, hungering
and thirsting for the negative answer which he did
not dare to so much as suggest.</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” said the doorkeeper briefly. “At
first I wasn’t so cocksure; it seemed like he’d gone
thinner just in that minute or two, so that his clothes
didn’t fit him so well; and he wasn’t swinging along
any more—he was going cautiouslike, as if he were
listening for something that he couldn’t hear. But of
course it was George. It couldn’t have been anybody
else, or I’d have seen him come up the stairs. See?”</p>

<p>If the man craved buttressing in his own belief it
was not denied him.</p>

<p>“Of course, it couldn’t have been any one else,”
Jarvis agreed. “Most likely George came back to ask
you something, didn’t find you at the door, and went
on again. Well, I must get a move. Good night.”</p>

<p>Thus Jarvis, with every word of the nonchalant
reply carefully weighted down with disinterest. But
when he had left the latter-day Egyptian on the corner,
repressed excitement found speech commensurate with
the importance of the new miracle.</p>

<p>“Holy Smoke! and yet they say there isn’t any
such thing as a miracle nowadays! Why, good Lord!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
here there have been two of them within an hour—within
fifteen minutes—and they go together like the
foot and the shoe! Yes, it was Brant—like fits! It
was his double in the stolen suit of black clothes—that’s
what Binkie saw! And he has been keeping it dark
because he was afraid of losing his job if he admitted
that some one might have made a sneak on him.”</p>

<p>This time Jarvis went straight to the editorial
rooms of the Plainsman, and, finding them untenanted,
sat down to wait with what patience he could muster
for the others to come in. The interval was not ill
spent. Before the reporter’s reverie was interrupted
he had cleared up more of the mysteries—so many of
them, indeed, that only one of any magnitude remained
to baffle him. But that one was impregnable. If the
unknown one were the murderer—and with this Jarvis
had closed as with a fact assured—why had the man
shot his late confederate?</p>

<p>In the meantime Antrim had killed his hour, and
had driven once more to Altamont Terrace. He found
the judge ready to accompany him, and from the
elder man’s grave preoccupation he argued that something
of moment had occurred in the interval of slain
time.</p>

<p>As prefigured, they drove by way of the Union
Depot and stopped to pick up Hobart. The train was
not yet in, and Antrim had time to run up to the
telegraph office. When he came down he was scowling
and cursing his luck.</p>

<p>Whereupon the judge came out of his preoccupation
enough to ask what had happened.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s that despatcher at Voltamo again; he is
always getting sick at the wrong time. I’ve got to drop
everything and ‘sub’ for him, and I suppose I shall
have to go up on Seventeen. That lets me out of
the conference, but I don’t know that I could do any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
good if I stayed. It isn’t going to make any difference.
It’s all up with poor Brant.”</p>

<p>The judge shook his head. “I must confess I don’t
see any light; but since Dorothy has told me—” He
broke off abruptly. “Do you know what she believes,
Harry?”</p>

<p>Antrim nodded.</p>

<p>“I—I more than half believe it myself, now,” the
judge admitted, and his voice had in it a tremulous
quaver which was not of age. “It is the height of incredibility;
it is more like a chapter out of some old
romance of the dead-and-gone age of chivalry, but—but——”</p>

<p>“I have believed it all along,” said Antrim.</p>

<p>“I know; I know you have. As you say, I don’t
see how we are to accomplish anything by talking it
over again to-night, but this I have determined: when
we have sifted it down to the last grain of evidence, I
shall go to the Governor and get him reprieved, if one
man may, with God’s help, move another to do a little
deed of mercy.”</p>

<p>“God bless you!” said Antrim fervently; and
then: “After it’s all over I wish you would drive by
and give the facts to the train despatcher upstairs—Disbrow,
you know. He’ll wire them to me on Seventeen
and I sha’n’t sleep much till I hear.”</p>

<p>The judge promised, and a moment later caught
sight of Hobart in the stream of outcoming passengers
from the delayed train. There was no time sacrificed
to the formalities, and when the assayer had shaken
hands with an old friend and a new one, the judge
passed quickly to the matter in hand.</p>

<p>“You are barely in time, Ned; we had despaired
of reaching you. Leave your valise at the check stand
and come uptown with me. I can explain what we
hope to do as we go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>As he promised, so he performed; and by the time
they reached the editor’s room at the top of the Plainsman
building, Hobart knew all that the judge could
tell him. Forsyth welcomed the newcomer heartily,
and then Jarvis was introduced.</p>

<p>“Here is a young man whom I have been misjudging
from the first,” said the night editor, by way of
preface to what the reporter had to tell. “While we
have been content to accept one theory, following it
blindly to its present desperate conclusion, he has
built up and torn down half a dozen, with the result
that he is ready to-night to open a most astounding
budget of discoveries.—Jarvis, do you begin at
the beginning and go over the ground carefully,
remembering that Mr. Hobart knows none of the
details.”</p>

<p>Jarvis drew up his chair, lighted a fresh cigar, and
told his story succinctly and with commendable clarity.
Hobart heard it through without comment, but at the
close of the narrative he fetched a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“These mysterious details, with their open doors
of possibility, help me out wonderfully,” he said. “As
you all know, I had my first news of the tragedy last
night, and it was meagre enough. But, from information
in my hands—in fact, from a letter which Brant
wrote me a short time before the shooting—I had every
reason to believe that he had simply avenged himself
on his enemy. Indeed, he swore he would do it if the
man ever crossed his path again.”</p>

<p>“His enemy?” echoed the judge.</p>

<p>“Yes. Listen, and I will tell you his story, so far
as I know it.”</p>

<p>He fulfilled the promise literally and truthfully,
beginning with their intimacy and close friendship in
college, and ending with a description of the impressive
parting in the moonlight on Jack Mountain, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
Brant had promised to turn his back upon his evil past
and to set his face toward better things.</p>

<p>“What has happened since that night you all know
better than I do,” he concluded. “But I may add this
from my knowledge of the man: As boy and youth
he had his faults, and the chiefest of these were impulsiveness
and a reckless uncounting of the cost when
he had set his heart upon doing a thing. But he was
always as loving and tender as a woman, and as chivalrous
as any Bayard of them all. Every one in college
knew what Harding’s sister was, and Brant was merely
a scapegoat for a half dozen worse men. But because
he, too, had sinned, he paid the penalty—would be paying
it to this day if the woman were alive. That was
one of his redeeming characteristics; and another was
his absolute and fearless truthfulness. If he says he
did not do this deed for which he is to suffer to-morrow
morning, that settles it. He wouldn’t lie about it if
the lie would save his life a dozen times over.”</p>

<p>The judge was profoundly moved. Twice he essayed
to speak, but what he had to say would have
naught of formal phrasings. And when he began, the
words came haltingly, and there was generous emotion
at the back of them.</p>

<p>“My good friends, this is no time to let false pride
or a strained sense of family honour stand in our way.
I have that to add to Mr. Hobart’s story which makes
the young man’s hitherto inexplicable reticence a part of
a most chivalrous and heroic purpose—a deed worthy of
the noblest knight that ever figured in ancient story.
From the moment of darkness in which the deed was
committed up to the present time Brant has believed
that my son was the murderer of James Harding, and it
was in this belief that he determined to sacrifice himself
to save the boy. What the ulterior motive was you
may perhaps divine for yourselves when I tell you that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
it was to my daughter, and after she had guessed his
purpose, that he admitted the fact.”</p>

<p>A silence more eloquent than the loudest praise fell
upon the little group gathered around the editor’s table.
Hobart was the first to break it.</p>

<p>“It was very like him,” he said softly; “like the
George Brant I used to know and love in the old days.
But in our admiration we mustn’t lose sight of his peril.
What are we to do?”</p>

<p>The judge shook his head. “While we have cleared
up many of the mysteries, we are still far from having a
reasonable excuse for asking the Governor’s intervention.
If I go to him with the story of these later discoveries
he may justly say that these things have no
bearing upon our case and refuse to grant a reprieve. I
presume it is sufficiently clear to all of us now that this
unknown man who broke into Brant’s room and stole
his clothes is the man who killed James Harding. But
we can neither prove this nor establish the motive. If
we could identify this man, and so be enabled to find
him, we might be able to show why he shot a person
with whom, by all accounts, he was on friendly terms.”</p>

<p>While the judge was speaking, Jarvis was sketching
a crude outline of a human face on the blotter under
his hand. He did it mechanically, and without realizing
that he was trying to draw the features of the man
of many descriptions. When he did realize it, he
passed the blotter across to Hobart with a query.</p>

<p>“Does that remind you of anybody you have ever
seen?”</p>

<p>Hobart shook his head.</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose it would,” said the reporter, taking
the blotter and beginning to obliterate the picture
by adding a bushy beard and a bristling mustache to
the face.</p>

<p>The judge and Forsyth were anxiously discussing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
the advisability of calling in the senior member of a
great law firm to act as a go-between in the appeal to
the Governor, the editor urging it and the lawyer objecting
on the score of time.</p>

<p>“It is my impression that he isn’t in town,” the
judge was saying. “And, in any event, what is done
must be done quickly. It is a matter of hours for
Brant now.”</p>

<p>Hobart took no part in the discussion. He was
leaning over the reporter’s shoulder watching the
strokes of the idle pencil. Suddenly he put out his
hand and stopped it:</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute; that begins to look something
like a man I’ve seen somewhere. Let me think.”</p>

<p>The exclamation drew the attention of the others,
and they examined the sketch while the assayer was
trying to recall the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Let me look at it again,” he said, and he knitted
his brows over it for a breathless minute while they
waited in silence.</p>

<p>“I can’t place it,” he added, at length. “I thought
at first it looked a little like the man Isaac Gasset.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked the reporter.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I mention him by name? He is the ruffian
who shot Harding’s sister in the affray at Gaynard’s—the
fellow that Brant winged and would have
killed, if I had let him.”</p>

<p>The editor’s pivot chair made a quick half circle,
and Forsyth smote upon the table with his fist in an
ecstasy of exprobration.</p>

<p>“What an infernal lot of idiotic chumps we are!—saving
your presence, judge,” he burst out. “Why,
the thing is as plain as daylight! Gasset is the man
who was plotting with Harding against Brant, and he
is the man who followed Brant into the Osirian that
night and fired the shot which killed Harding. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
that shot missed its mark; it was meant for George
Brant!”</p>

<p>Hobart’s pose was self-repression, but he sprang to
his feet with something very like an imprecation.
“Why, of course! If I’d had any time at all to pull
myself together! Why, gentlemen, I <i>knew</i>—knew all
about it, but it didn’t occur to me. This man Gasset
got out of the hospital before I left Silverette, and it
was the talk of the camp that he was hunting for Brant
with blood in his eye. I meant to write George about
it at the time; but since he had cut the whole business
I didn’t think there was any great danger.”</p>

<p>But it was the judge who went to the heart of the
matter in two words. “Thank God!” he said earnestly,
“at last we have something with which to go
to his Excellency, the Governor. And afterward, if
we can only lay hands on this man Gasset——”</p>

<p>There was a volley fire of suggestions from Hobart
and Jarvis, but the night editor’s genius for organization
came quickly to the fore:</p>

<p>“We shall have him, if he is anywhere this side
of his master’s smelting pot, and——”</p>

<p>“And when you find him,” Jarvis cut in, “he
will probably have in his possession a big 45-calibre
Colt’s with the name ‘J. Harding’ scratched on the
butt.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? how do you know?” demanded
Forsyth; and the marshalling of forces paused while
Jarvis explained.</p>

<p>“I know, because the existence of that same big
pistol has been the one thing which has kept me alive.
Everybody took it for granted that the murder was
committed with the pistol which was found on the
floor. I wasn’t sure of that, and when I began to doubt,
I saw the possibility of another weapon and another
man behind it. Gasset was the man who had the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
‘J. Harding’ weapon at the time of the killing, and
if he still has it when we catch him—if we catch him—it
will be a strong point in evidence if he happens to
have the pistol he stole from Brant’s room in his possession.”</p>

<p>“It is a good point, and we’ll put it in the telegrams,”
said the editor. “Now, gentlemen, to work.
Judge Langford, if you will go with Mr. Hobart to the
Governor’s house, Jarvis and I will see to the telegraphing,
and I’ll have my young men ransack the city—they
will do it better and quicker than the police. Jarvis,
send the boys in here, and then chase over to the jail
and get word to Brant—if it costs money.” Then to
the judge: “You think there is no doubt about your
being able to make your case with his Excellency?”</p>

<p>“None whatever now, I think.”</p>

<p>“Good. Then we’ll all meet here in two hours and
compare notes, if you please.”</p>

<p>It was an hour after midnight when Despatcher
Disbrow was finally able to answer Antrim’s impatient
inquiries from Voltamo. He gave the chief clerk the
story of the later discoveries, closing the long message
with a succinct account of what had been accomplished
up to date:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They have ascertained that Gasset left town on
night of the murder, and the wires are hot after him
with a big reward out. Governor has granted a reprieve,
and Brant has been notified. Judge L. says
Gasset must be found and made to confess; otherwise
Brant’s case still hangs on the ragged edge. Call up
again in the morning.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Disbrow.</span>”</p>
</div>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI<br>

<small>IN WHICH A FOX DOUBLES ONCE TOO OFTEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is conceivable that Henry Antrim clicked his
“O. K.” at the close of the wire talk with Despatcher
Disbrow with a lighter heart than he had carried for
many a day. Truly, everything still hinged upon the
capture of Gasset, but the blessed optimism of youth
is always ready to make light of contingencies, and the
chief clerk threw himself upon the night operator’s
bunk to snatch a few hours’ rest, little thinking that
the conclusion of the whole matter still hung in a balance
whose beam would tip as his own energy and presence
of mind might decide. And while he slept, the
net spread so promptly by the whispering wires was already
entangling the murderer.</p>

<p>With the criminal’s instinctive distrust of small
towns to narrow his choice of a refuge, Gasset had put
his fate into the keeping of chance by spinning a coin:
heads, to lose himself in the untabulated crowds thronging
the streets and byways of Leadville; tails, to drop
from the train at some lonely station in the mountains,
whence he could make his way on foot to one of
the more isolated camps. The chance of the spun coin
sent him to Leadville; and when, on the second morning
of his sojourn in the carbonate camp, he learned
from the newspapers that his bad aim had disposed of
an inconvenient accomplice without materially marring
his plan of vengeance on Brant, he exulted openly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
from that on went his way without concealment, believing
that he had safely outrun his evil hour.</p>

<p>For this cause it came about that the Leadville reduplication
of the telegram offering a reward for his
arrest was scarcely an hour old when a police officer interrupted
a quiet game of cards in a den in lower State
Street, laid hands upon the winner, a big-boned man in
an ill-fitting suit of dusty black, searched him, and took
from him a big revolver with the name “J. Harding”
scratched on the butt.</p>

<p>Gasset surrendered at discretion, not suspecting the
nature of the charge against him, and, having a due regard
for the possibilities of escape, made no resistance
which should warrant the use of the handcuffs. So
all went amicably until the officer, who was less discreet
than his prisoner, told Gasset for what he was wanted.
At the naming of the thing the ex-house-breaker caught
his breath, set his teeth upon a fiercely growled oath,
smote his captor skilfully upon the point of the jaw,
and made a wild dash for liberty.</p>

<p>The policeman gave chase courageously, ignoring
the broken jaw and firing ever and anon at the dodging
fugitive. But Gasset made good his escape, threading
the intricacies of alleys and streets in the lower town
until, by the time the hue and cry was properly raised,
he was free of the houses and skirting the slope of the
mountain which overlooks California Gulch. Here he
might have rested, but the terror of it was too new
upon him. So he pushed on and always on over the
bleak mountain side, doubling and twisting on his
course, and cursing the snow which at day dawn would
point a sure trail for his pursuers to follow. And thus
running and stumbling and cursing, he came out finally
in the stunted pine <i>chapparal</i> opposite the railway station
at Malta.</p>

<p>From this point three ways were open to him. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
might turn his face northward toward the new camps
beyond Tennessee Pass, avoiding the railroad and trusting
to the hospitality of the mountains for succour of
bread and meat on the way. He might push westward
over one of the passes to the sparsely settled gulches
beyond the main range, but this was a still more precarious
bread-and-meat hazard. Or, lastly, he might
follow the railroad to the eastward, putting the chance
of better speed and fewer privations against the greater
risk of discovery and capture.</p>

<p>He knew well enough that either of the foot flights
would be safer than the alternative; but it was late
in the season, and the early snows promised hardships
a-plenty. While he was yet weighing these hardships
against the perils of the easier route, an east-bound
freight train crawling slowly through the Malta yards
turned the scale, and dashing swiftly across the tracks
he climbed catlike into an empty box car what time the
train was gathering headway for the rush down the
valley.</p>

<p>At the moment of decision he had no plan more
definite than the putting of as great a distance as possible
between himself and the scene of his late encounter
with the Leadville officer; but by the time the
morning sun was gilding the snow-capped peaks of
Princeton and Harvard he had hit upon a strategic series
of moves which was not less ingenious than it was daring.
Knowing that he could not hope to remain undiscovered
in the box car after daybreak, he determined
to leave the freight train at the first stop, to wait for
and board the early east-bound passenger, to ride thereon
openly until his identity and ostensible intention
were discovered, and then to take the chance of out-witting
everybody by doubling back to the westward
from the meeting point of the two day trains.</p>

<p>It was a hazardous game to play, with the noose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
of the hangman at the end of it as a penalty for unsuccess;
but he could think of no better. The chief hazards
were two: If his identification should come too
soon, he would be obliged to leave the east-bound train
before it should reach the meeting point, and there
would be the desperate risk of waiting at some small
station until the west-bound train should arrive. And
if it should be delayed until the moment of doubling,
he would lose all upon the single throw. But, on the
other hand, if the stratagem succeeded, if he should
be lucky enough to send the hunt eastward on a false
scent, much precious time would be gained and present
safety would be fairly well assured.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan he dropped from the
freight train while it was slowing into Buena Vista, and
was so far successful as to find a hiding place in which
he could watch and wait unobserved for the east-bound
passenger. When that came, and he had taken a seat
in the smoking car, the perils began. The conductor
eyed him suspiciously, took his fare to Denver, and a
little later came back to sit down for a friendly chat
which soon developed by insensible degrees into a
cross-examination. Gasset answered as best he might,
writhing and swearing under his breath. It was what
he had expected and provided for, but it had come too
soon. The conductor desisted finally and went about
his business, but Gasset drew fresh breath of alarm
when he saw the brakeman lounge forward to take his
seat on one of the newsboy’s boxes. And when the
brakeman kept his place doggedly past station after station,
ignoring his duties, Gasset argued that he was already
under surveillance and began to nerve himself
for whatever desperate struggle was in store for him.</p>

<p>The fugitive’s surmise was entirely correct. Since
early morning the wires had been buzzing with the
news of the night; and inasmuch as the railway afforded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
the most obvious line of escape, every trainman was
on the watch for the man whose description had been
sown broadcast by the telltale wires. For this cause,
and knowing both the fact of the reward and the figure
of it, Conductor Harker thought himself in luck. Voltamo
was the first station ahead where a constable could
be found; and to Voltamo the conductor wired at the
first opportunity.</p>

<p>Antrim was at his post in the telegraph office, filling
the place of the invalided branch despatcher, when the
conductor’s message arrived, and he took it upon himself
to make sure that the town marshal and two deputies
were at the station to meet the train. That done,
he waited in a fever of impatience for the event to mature,
and when the suspense indoors became unbearable,
he gave his place to the day operator and went out to be
in at the death.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. The whistle of the coming
train was echoing in the upper cañon, and the little
knot of loungers which had gathered about the marshal
and his deputies broke apart and fell back to give
the officers free play. There was a west-bound freight in
the upper yard, waiting, with a man at the switch, to
pull out after the passenger train should arrive; and the
rear trucks of the latter were no more than fairly over
the movable rail before it was set for the siding, and the
freight began to worm its way out around the double
curve.</p>

<p>The incoming passenger train slid down the grade
to the station with brake shoes smoking, and Conductor
Harker swung off and caught himself with a quick little
run.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him!—alive and kicking. He’s in the forward
end of the smoker,” he cried; and in a flash the
marshal darted into one end of the car while his deputies
cut off the retreat at the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>Something to the surprise of all three, they met in
the middle of the car without their quarry. There were
not more than a dozen passengers in the seats, and no
one of them remotely answered the requirements of the
Gasset description. The marshal threw up a window
and yelled to the conductor:</p>

<p>“Come in here and show us your man!”</p>

<p>Harker was with them at the word, but there was
blank astoundment in his face. “Suffering Moses!
you’ve let him get away!” he gasped. “He was right
there in that second seat not more than a minute ago
when we pulled down over the switch!”</p>

<p>“Well, you can see for yourself he isn’t here now,”
quoth the marshal. “You hold the train a minute
while we look through the other cars.”</p>

<p>The detention was not called for. Voltamo is a
locomotive division station, and before the engines
were changed the marshal and his aids had searched
every possible hiding place in the train. Antrim
knew that they had done their duty faithfully, but
he was exasperated at the conductor’s apparent neglect.</p>

<p>“It is all your fault, Harker!” he said hotly.
“You ought to have had sense enough to keep your eyes
or your hands on him!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t saying a word,” said Harker. “But what
can I do now?”</p>

<p>“Do? Why, take your train and go on. There
isn’t anything to stop for now that he’s gone.”</p>

<p>The conductor obeyed, glad enough to be out of it,
and Antrim turned to the marshal. “I’m sorry I got
you out on a wild-goose chase,” he said. “What do you
suppose became of him? Or did Harker only imagine
he had him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was there, right enough. I asked some of
the passengers in the smoker and they all saw him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
By gravy! look at that, will you?—fell plum from the
top o’ the car and never turned a hair!”</p>

<p>Antrim looked, and saw much more than did the
marshal. The west-bound freight had stalled on the
double curve, and during the detention of the passenger
train had been backing and filling to get headway.
Just as the marshal spoke a drawbar pulled out,
and the sudden jerk of the forward section flung a man
who was clinging to the roof-hold of a box car far out
into the ditch. He was on his feet again in a twinkling,
making a quick run for a hand car which stood blocked
on a siding.</p>

<p>Antrim yelled as he saw him kick the block from beneath
the wheel and scramble upon the deck of the car.</p>

<p>“That’s your man! Wing him as he goes by or he’ll
get away yet! There’s a safety switch at the lower end,
and the car will jump it and keep the track!”</p>

<p>The man threw himself fiercely upon the driving
lever of the hand car, and the light gear truck came
spinning down the grade under his vigorous strokes.
The marshal and his two aids coolly drew their weapons
and waited. The fugitive would have to pass within
thirty feet of the platform, and the marksmen could
afford to wait until the flying target was at short range.
At the critical instant the three pistols cracked as one,
and the toiling figure at the lever dropped behind the
gear casing as the car shot past with ever-increasing
momentum.</p>

<p>“Heavens and earth, I hope you haven’t killed
him!” panted Antrim, while they were running down
the track after the retreating hand car. “He’s got to
talk some before he dies.”</p>

<p>“He’ll never do that,” said the marshal confidently.
“He’ll never wag his jaw any more this side of the
range. I don’t miss—By gravy! do you see that?”</p>

<p>The four pursuers stopped in speechless astoundment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
The hand car had reached the safety switch,
clearing it at a bound and alighting fairly upon the
rails of the main line, and at the same instant the prone
figure behind the gear casing straightened up and flung
itself once more upon the rocking lever. Two pistols
crashed simultaneously, and then the car with its labouring
burden dodged out of sight and range around
an elbow in the lower cañon.</p>

<p>“G-g-great Scott! M-m-missed him all the t-time!”
stammered one of the deputies, whose speech failed him
at a crisis; and the big marshal flung his weapon down
and ground it into the ballast under his heel in a fine
frenzy of impotent wrath.</p>

<p>Antrim was the first to recover presence of mind, or
some semblance of it. “Come back with me and we’ll
catch him yet!” he shouted, leading the race up the
yard toward the relieved passenger engine, which the
engineer was about to back under the coal chute. A
breathless minute later they were clambering aboard,
and the engineer recognised the chief clerk.</p>

<p>“Catch that hand car for us, Tom!” gasped Antrim,
fighting for breath and coherence. “There’s a—there’s
a man’s life depending on it. Turn her loose!”</p>

<p>The engineer nodded and dropped the reversing
lever forward with a crash. One of the yard men saw
them coming and ran to set the switch, and in a gathering
tempest of clamour the engine shot out on the
main line and the chase began afresh.</p>

<p>Two miles down the cañon they came in sight of
the hand car darting around the curves ahead of them.
Gasset had abandoned the lever when the increasing
speed of the car made it dangerous to try to keep up
with the quick strokes of it, and was crouching on the
deck, screening himself as well as he could behind the
driving mechanism. Seeing this, the marshal borrowed
the stuttering deputy’s revolver and watched his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
chances for another shot. Antrim saw, and shook his
head, shouting to make himself heard above the din
and clamour of the flying locomotive:</p>

<p>“Don’t kill him; we must take him alive, if we
can.”</p>

<p>The marshal lowered the weapon, and the engineer
signed to Antrim to come closer. “We can’t make it,”
he protested, giving the spinning wheels a taste of the
air brake. “He’s got the hill with him, and that light
car will keep the track when we can’t. See?”</p>

<p>Antrim nodded. “Keep him in sight, if you can,”
he shouted back. “If you can hold your own till we
come to that let-up in the grade at Berg Siding, maybe
we can run him down.”</p>

<p>But the end of the chase was nearer, though it need
not have been if Gasset could have had the courage of
his despair. Before the “let-up” came in sight there
was a series of blood-chilling curves around which the
hand car lurched with increasing velocity. Gasset’s
hand sought the brake lever. The fusillade of pistol
shots, the swift down-rush between the echoing walls
of the cañon, the hopelessness of any escape from the
shrieking monster in the rear, all went to the unnerving
of him, and he applied the brake before he fully realized
what would follow any sudden checking of speed in that
tortuous pathway.</p>

<p>What did follow brought the chase to a calamitous
end. The flying wheels of the light car answered
promptly to the pressure of the brake, and the car
plunged sullenly through a cutting, promising to come
to a full stop on the curve beyond. The hunted one
sprang to his feet and kicked savagely at the brake
lever. It was jammed, and he was too late. The pursuing
locomotive dashed through the cutting and was
fairly upon him before he could jump and save himself.</p>

<p>Antrim saw the doomed one kicking at the jammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
lever and heard his scream of terror and the crash
of the collision in the same pulse beat. What came
after seemed like the awakening from a hideous dream,
though the realities asserted themselves once more when
they were lifting him from the wreck of the shattered
hand car. “There is life in him yet; handle him gently,
boys,” he said. “If he dies before he can talk an
innocent man will hang for it.”</p>

<p>They made a rude bed for him with their coats in
the empty coal pit on the engine, and so got the
crushed body of him back to Voltamo and to a bunk in
the freight shed at the station. Antrim could not neglect
his duties, but the physician’s verdict cheered him
a little.</p>

<p>“He is a dead man,” so ran the verdict, “and that
probably within twenty-four hours. But there is a
chance that he will revive a little toward the last.”</p>

<p>“A chance that he will be able to tell us what we
have to know?” asked Antrim.</p>

<p>“Yes. Have your lawyer here, and the witnesses.
When the man begins to find himself, call me, and I’ll
try to keep him alive till you get what you need—that
is, if he will give it to you.”</p>

<p>“He has got to give it to us,” returned Antrim
desperately; and when he had made all the preparations
suggested by the physician he telegraphed the facts to
Forsyth, and settled down to work his way through the
grimmest day of waiting that has ever been marked off
in any calendar of suspense.</p>

<p>The end came in the dusk of the evening when the
shadows were beginning to fill the deeper clefts in the
mighty cañon. Gasset opened his eyes, stirred feebly,
and asked for liquor; and Antrim called the lawyer and
the witnesses, and sent out in hot haste for the physician.</p>

<p>As it fell out, there was time and to spare; time for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
halting confession from the dying murderer, in which
he told no more lies than he could help; time, needless
time, after that for the slow and reluctant passing of a
hopeless soul from a maimed and tortured body. Antrim
drew breath of blessed relief when it was all over,
but it was a full hour afterward before he could compose
himself sufficiently to send a second telegram to Forsyth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Gasset died at 7.12 this <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> He was conscious

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVII<br>

<small>THE LAW OF THE MEDES AND PERSIANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">So</span> you have quite made up your mind to leave
Denver, have you?”</p>

<p>It was the day of deliverance, and Hobart, claiming
the elder right, had met Brant at the opening of the
prison doors, whisking him off straightway to Elitch’s
and to a private box therein, where they could have a
quiet talk over their luncheon and a quiet smoke afterward.</p>

<p>Brant shrugged. “That says itself, doesn’t it? I
am not wholly shameless. After all the free advertising
I have been getting lately, people will stop and point
me out in the streets.”</p>

<p>Hobart’s laugh was a friendly jeer. “That is what
you get for trying to play the part of Providence—a not
altogether blameless Providence, either, since you were
going to let a judge and a jury hang an innocent man.
How did you come to get so befogged in the ethical
part of you?”</p>

<p>Brant waved the question aside in the gesture which
flicked the ash from his cigar.</p>

<p>“‘There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
than are dreamt of in your philosophy,’” he
quoted. “We’ll drop that part of it, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“But I do mind; I am curious to know.”</p>

<p>Brant did not hasten to explain, and when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
spoke again it was to ask a seemingly irrelevant question.</p>

<p>“Do you know what it means to love a woman,
Ned?”</p>

<p>“I’m supposed to, am I not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There’s many a man married—happily
married, too—who doesn’t know what it means.
Luckily for the common good, the kind of love I have
in mind is a thing apart. It is both more and less than
a passion; it is a mania in the sense that it blinds the
eye to everything save the present happiness of its object.
Can you grasp that?”</p>

<p>“Ye-yes, in a measure. But in your case there were
so many things to be considered——”</p>

<p>“There was no time to consider them. In such a
crisis one must act first and think afterward. At the
critical moment I thought of but one thing—the misery
of one woman if her brother should not have a chance
to run for his life.”</p>

<p>Hobart nodded. “I can follow you that far. But
afterward, when you found he wasn’t going to run for
it?”</p>

<p>“That was another matter. I was bitter, at first; I
had given him his chance, I thought, and he was contemptible
enough to deny me mine. But I had time
enough to think then; to see that the object to be attained
remained the same; to see what a sorry sham I
was and had been. It broke me, Ned; and while I was
down I made a clean sweep of it. I hadn’t killed James
Harding, as it happened, but under other conditions
I might have killed him—should have killed him, I
said. In which case the judge and jury couldn’t err
greatly in hanging me.”</p>

<p>Hobart heard him through, but at the summing up
he scoffed openly. “That is the baldest sophistry,
George, and you know it,” he asserted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>Brant smiled. “Perhaps it is; but you must remember
that I loved the woman. I meant never to
speak of this to any one, Ned; none the less, I am glad
you have made me speak of it to you.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because if you can’t understand it, nobody else
ever will. Shall we bury it and talk about something
else?”</p>

<p>“It is dead and buried from this time on,” rejoined
Hobart loyally. “But you are wrong when you say
that I don’t understand. It is precisely because I
do understand all you’ve admitted, and a lot more besides,
that I am willing to give you all the rope you
want. When a man makes seventeen different kinds of
a knight-errant of himself in this cold-blooded age, he
earns privileges that we ordinary mortals are bound to
respect. This is my last word. Now, then, what are
you going to do with yourself?”</p>

<p>“The one thing needful has been done for me.
Colonel Bowran did not wait to be told that I should
probably want to disappear. He took it for granted,
and got me an appointment as engineer in charge of the
work on the Chipeta Ditch down in the San Juan.”</p>

<p>“Is it a good billet?”</p>

<p>“Good pay and a deep grave; and the latter is all I
yearn for just now. The colonel says there has not yet
been so much as a stake driven on the preliminary survey.
If I take it I can drop out of sight and hearing
for a year or two at least.”</p>

<p>“You say ‘if.’ Of course, you will take it.”</p>

<p>Brant took time to balance his fruit knife accurately
on the edge of his plate before he made answer. “I am
not so sure about that,” he said finally. “It will depend
very much upon the outcome of a little talk I
mean to have with a certain lady.”</p>

<p>“Miss Langford?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>“No; Miss Langford’s mother.”</p>

<p>Hobart whistled softly. “Going to carry it up to
the supreme court, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and at once. Then I shall know better what
I am going to do.”</p>

<p>“It is none of my business, George, but I am afraid
the time isn’t propitious.”</p>

<p>“So am I; but it is all the time I have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that doesn’t follow. And if you were to go
away and stay till the edge has time to wear off—from
what you have told me I fancy Dorothy will wait indefinitely.”</p>

<p>“She will; and we shall have to wait in any event;
but that isn’t the point. When I go, if I go, I must
carry with me the assurance that bygones will be bygones
when I come back.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that smack a little of doing good that good
may come?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. You see that, notwithstanding your good
opinion, there is nothing superhuman about me. But
it is more than that, Ned. I mean to marry Dorothy
some day, God willing, but it sha’n’t be until I have had
it out with myself, nor even then without her mother’s
fullest consent and approval. This last I am willing to
try to earn, but I want some assurance that it is among
the possibilities.”</p>

<p>Hobart followed out his own line of thought, and it
presently led him back to the original proposition.
“You will ‘gang yer ain gate,’ as you usually do, I suppose;
but, as I remarked a minute ago, the time isn’t
ripe. I have seen something of the family in the last
few days—with my eyes open—and I can tell you pretty
nearly how you stand. Dorothy would go to the stake
for you, the judge would divide his ultimate dollar with
you, Isabel worships you from afar, William the Curst
swears by you, and Mrs. Langford—well, she doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
say much before me, as a matter of course, but it is as
plain as the nose on your face that she has small use
for you in spite of everything.”</p>

<p>“That is no more or less than I expected. None
the less, I am going to see her—to-night.”</p>

<p>“Amen. I like your pluck, even if it is a bit like
the zeal not according to knowledge that we read about.
I shall be there—under the same ridgepole, at least.
Is there anything I can do to help out?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; unless you will be charitable enough to
stand by to pick up the pieces after she has demolished
me. Shall we adjourn?—if you are through. I have
some writing to do, likewise a bit of provisional packing.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVIII<br>

<small>IN WHICH DARTS ARE COUNTED AS STUBBLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of a somewhat diversified experience
Brant had been constrained to fight his way through a
few measurably perilous passages, and in such crises
those who liked him least were fain to concede his
courage. None the less, when the day of liberation
darkened to its evening he went leaden-footed to the
interview with Dorothy’s mother.</p>

<p>Now Hobart, in the goodness of his heart, had
caused it to be whispered about that Brant would probably
make his farewell call that evening, and for this
reason it was Dorothy, and no hireling, who answered
the bell.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said of Brant (and his most loyal
apologist is fain to admit that his shortcomings were
many and variegated), he was no laggard in love; and
when he made sure of the identity of his unexpected
welcomer, Dorothy had no cause to doubt the warmth
of his passion. Nevertheless, she blushed and struggled
a little—as what modest young woman, however
affectionate, would not in a well-lighted reception hall
which was a thoroughfare for the entire household?
And so, mutely protesting, she drew him quickly into
the library.</p>

<p>“Only a moment with you, my love,” he said tenderly;
“just long enough to hear you say it again. Are
you quite sure you love me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>She hid her face on his arm—she was not tall
enough to reach his shoulder. “I—I’d be ashamed to
tell you how long I have been sure of it,” she confessed
with sweet <i>naïveté</i>.</p>

<p>Whereat he kissed the parting of her hair.</p>

<p>“Thank you for that word, my darling. It would
hold a worse man than I ever dared to be true to his
purpose. Now there is but one thing more: we must
have your mother’s consent and approval. Will you go
and send her to me?”</p>

<p>But Dorothy hesitated, as well she might.</p>

<p>“If you are sure you must speak to her now,” she
ventured to say. “But, oh, I am afraid——”</p>

<p>At that he drew her closer, and for some ecstatic
moment the hard thing that remained became as
naught. “The day of fear and trembling is past, little
one, and whatever befalls, whatever your mother may
say, we shall still belong to each other. And I will
wait and serve for you, my love, as Jacob served for
Rachel, if need be. Now kiss me good-bye, dear, and
go—before the love of you unmans me.”</p>

<p>She lifted tear-brimmed eyes to his and said: “Oh,
no; it must not be good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Only for a little while, sweetheart. I’ll join
you with the others when I have done what I must
do.”</p>

<p>“With the others? But how shall I know what she
has said?”</p>

<p>He smiled and once more kissed the parting of her
hair. “You’ll know without the telling, my beloved.
And if you are the first to welcome me, I’ll know you
know. Now go, and let me have it over with.”</p>

<p>She went obediently at that, and when she was
gone, Brant began to walk the floor and to call up all his
reserves of fortitude and courage, being well assured
that he would presently need them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>While he was yet planning the assault, and before
the flanking regiments were properly wheeled into line,
the door opened behind him and he turned to confront
not Mrs. Langford, as he had anticipated, but her son.
The “unlicked cub” came in, swaggering a little as
was his wont; but when he had closed the door and
so shut himself in with his redoubtable preserver,
he had an attack of embarrassment which quickly
put to flight the offhand greeting he had meant to
offer. Whereupon, instead of carrying it off with
the easy nonchalance of a man of the world, he stammered
like any schoolboy and Brant had to come to the
rescue.</p>

<p>“How are you, Will? I am glad to see you,” he
said, truthfully enough.</p>

<p>The unchastised one felt that some acknowledgment
of his immense obligation to Brant ought properly
to precede any mere desultory talk, but to save his life
he could not twist his tongue to anything like the adequate
speech. So he spoke of Brant’s plans rather than
of the obligation.</p>

<p>“Heard you were off to the San Juan; Harry told
us, you know. Jolly good layout, too, isn’t it? By
gad, don’t you know I envy you?—no, that isn’t what I
meant to say. Fact is, Mr. Brant, you see I’ve been
hanging ’round the door so long waiting for Dorothy to
come out that it’s got me rattled. What I wanted to
ask was if you wouldn’t take me along. I reckon I
don’t know enough about engineering to hurt me any—nothing
much but what I learned at school—and folks
say I’m too dead tough to breathe, but I’d like to learn,
and—well, I don’t know, but I reckon I’ll never be any
account till I get to work, and if anybody can brace me
up, it’s you, and——”</p>

<p>Brant was generous enough to break in and so supply
the period the boy was so helplessly pursuing; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
he did it the more readily since he felt the sudden and
urgent prompting of a new and imperative duty.</p>

<p>“If you will agree to carry chain and drive stakes
to begin with, you may count it a settled thing so far
as I am concerned,” he said. “But how about your
father and mother? Will they let you go?”</p>

<p>“The governor’s all right; I’ve just had a talk
with him, and he is so glad to get rid of me that he is
scared to death for fear you won’t take me. And the
mother will be all right, too; she’ll do anything I want
her to, same as she always does, you know. I’ll go and
tell her now, before——”</p>

<p>But just then the door opened again, and Mrs. Langford
needed not to be sought. She came in with the
air of one who does an unavoidable thing reluctantly,
but her stateliness abated visibly at sight of her son.
The “cub” promptly forestalled anything in the way of
preliminary formalities.</p>

<p>“Just this minute talking about you, mother,” he
burst out, in happy ignorance of constraints or embarrassments,
social or other. “Come and shake hands
with Mr. Brant and congratulate him on getting out of
the horrible scrape I got him into. But that isn’t what
we were talking about, you know; he starts for the San
Juan to-morrow morning—going down to take charge
of the Chipeta work—and he has promised to take me
with him.”</p>

<p>“Subject, of course, to your approval and Judge
Langford’s,” amended Brant, with a bow in Mrs. Langford’s
direction.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course; but I told you that would be all
right. What’s the matter with you, mother? Can’t
you manage to thank Mr. Brant? It’s jolly good of
him, y’know.”</p>

<p>“I—why, William, dear, this is dreadfully sudden!
I didn’t know you were even thinking of such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
thing!” The good lady had formulated quite a number
of cool little speeches wherewith to dampen any
small spark of ardour which the unwelcome visitor
might attempt to blow alive, but here was a contingency
for which no forethought could have made provision.
So she hesitated, and before the needed access of severity
came to forbid it she was doing very nearly as her
son had commanded.</p>

<p>“We are glad—very glad, I am sure, Mr. Brant,”
she faltered, not knowing just how fittingly to congratulate
a man upon having got out of jail—out of the
very noose of the hangman. “This is really an unexpected
pleasure—no, not quite that, either, for I got
your note. But about this—this expedition; I am
afraid— Hasn’t William been taking too much for
granted?”</p>

<p>“Not on my part,” rejoined Brant civilly. “I assure
you I shall be glad enough to have him with me,
if he may go with your consent.”</p>

<p>“But it is so very sudden,” the mother protested,
still unable to orient herself. “I had thought—that
is, I had been led to believe that you came upon quite a
different errand, Mr. Brant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course; he came to see Dorothy,” said William
with brotherly brutality. “But that’s all right.
They’ll have time enough to say any quantity of good-byes
while you’re helping me to pack. Come on upstairs
with me, please; I can’t begin to find half of my
things if you don’t help me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langford gave up in mute despair; and Brant
was beginning to fear that his errand would have to go
undone; but at that moment the “cub” rescued the
vanishing opportunity by rushing off to begin his preparations.
Thus the mother and her visitor were left
alone together, and Brant seized his courage with both
hands:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>“Mrs. Langford, one moment, if you please. You
know why I came here to-night, and what I meant to
ask. My happiness, which you may justly ignore, and
that of your daughter, which is of far greater moment,
depend upon your answer. Will you give it me now?
or must I wait till I have earned a better right to it?”</p>

<p>He spoke hurriedly as the occasion compelled, and
she heard him through without interrupting. When
he paused she took his arm a little stiffly and led him
toward the door.</p>

<p>“You will find the family in the drawing-room, Mr.
Brant; and I hope you will excuse me if I go upstairs
to help William. And, as I may not come down before
you go, I will bid you good-bye now. I hope you will do
well, and—and that you will succeed in whatever you
undertake.”</p>

<p>They had reached the hall, and she turned and held
out her hand. Brant took it and bowed low over it.</p>

<p>“Then I am to understand——”</p>

<p>“This: that I am willing to be neutral, and to wait.”</p>

<p>“It is all I ask,” he said gratefully, quelling a sudden
and mighty insurrection of joy that threatened to
unseat his self-control.</p>

<p>“It is all I can promise, now. Be lenient with me,
Mr. Brant, as I shall try to be with you. You know my
views, and you also know whether they are unsupported
by reason and justice. I will say frankly that I came
down a few moments ago to urge you to spare me; to
tell you that I could not reconcile myself to this thing
that you and my daughter have set your hearts upon.
But while I delayed, you forestalled me with my son.
He is my hostage, and I surrender him to you because
I can not help myself; but when you return I shall require
him at your hands. Deal gently with him, I beg
of you—for his sister’s sake, if not for mine.”</p>

<p>She turned to go upstairs, and he stood aside to let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
her pass. “God do so to me, and more, if I do not regard
him as the son of my own mother,” he said solemnly,
and the promise touched her.</p>

<p>“I believe you—and trust you,” she added, pausing
on the step above him. “Now go and join the others
in the drawing-room. They will all be glad to welcome
you.”</p>

<p>And they were; but Dorothy the most of all. For
in his eyes she read the promise of the future, and ran
to be the first to greet him. And though the others
pressed upon him with kindly words and hearty hand-grips,
he saw but one—the woman for whose love he
lived, and would have died.</p>

Thomas</span>. Illustrated by Emil Pollak. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.50.</span></p>

<p>“By far the most complete and satisfying description that
has been given of life in the Italian quarter of New York....
Incidentally a very good novel, reasonable in its purpose and
character drawing, intricate in plot, and dramatic in its action.”—<i>Philadelphia
Times.</i></p>

<p>“A breezy book. It ‘goes’ from start to finish, and the action
moves in a rich atmosphere, albeit that of the poorest of
New York’s alien colonies.... The best study of Italian life
in New York, and of its special environment that has ever been
drawn.”—<i>New York Herald.</i></p>

<p>“Through a very cleverly contrived course of events the
complex life of the colony shines out in most resplendent proportions....
The story is an exceedingly clever piece of humorous
writing.”—<i>Pittsburg Chronicle-Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>“The author has evidently made a close study of the Italian
quarter and its people and customs, and has utilized his knowledge
to best advantage.”—<i>Denver Republican.</i></p>

<p>“Character drawing and humor of an excellent quality.”—<i>Rochester
Herald.</i></p>

<p>“Richly humorous, ‘The Last Lady of Mulberry’ is one
of the most enjoyable little romances we have recently read. It
presents a picture of the Little Italy known in all our larger cities
in a way that is more effective than any number of serious dissertations.”—<i>Providence
News.</i></p>

very real and pure, which in its telling shows us some strong points of Welsh
character—the pride, the hasty temper, the quick dying out of wrath.... We
call this a well-written story, interesting alike through its romance and its
glimpses into another life than ours.”—<i>Detroit Free Press.</i></p>

This stirring romance has been compared

<p><span class="large">Being Recollections of the first Four Years of my Sea Life.
Illustrated. Uniform Edition. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</span></p>

<p>The brilliant author of “The Cruise of the Cachalot” and “Idylls of the
Sea” presents in this new work the continuous story of the actual experiences
of his first four years at sea. In graphic and picturesque phrases he has sketched
the events of voyages to the West Indies, to Bombay and the Coromandel coast,
to Melbourne and Rangoon. Nothing could be of more absorbing interest
than this wonderfully vivid account of foks’l humanity, and the adventures and
strange sights and experiences attendant upon deep-sea voyages. It is easy to see
in this book an English companion to our own “Two Years before the Mast.”</p>

<p><span class="large"><b>Idylls of the Sea.</b></span></p>

<p><span class="large">12mo. Cloth, $1.25.</span></p>

<p>“The ‘deep-sea wonder and mystery’ which Kipling found in Frank T.
Bullen’s ‘Cruise of the Cachalot’ is appreciable again in this literary mate’s
new book, ‘Idylls of the Sea.’ We feel ourselves tossed with him at the
mercy of the weltering elements,” etc.—<i>Philadelphia Record.</i></p>

<p>“Amplifies and intensifies the picture of the sea which Mr. Bullen had
already produced.... Calm, shipwreck, the surface and depths of the sea,
the monsters of the deep, superstitions and tales of the sailors—all find a place
in this strange and exciting book.”—<i>Chicago Times-Herald.</i></p>

<p><span class="large"><b>The Cruise of the Cachalot,</b></span></p>

<p><span class="large">Round the World after Sperm Whales. Illustrated. 12mo.
Cloth, $ 1.50.</span></p>

<p>“It is immense—there is no other word. I’ve never read anything that
equals it in its deep-sea wonder and mystery, nor do I think that any book before
has so completely covered the whole business of whale fishing, and, at the same
time, given such real and new sea pictures. I congratulate you most heartily.
It’s a new world you’ve opened the door to.”—<i>Rudyard Kipling.</i></p>

<p>“Written with racy freedom of literary expression and luxuriant abundance
of incident, so that ‘The Cruise of the Cachalot’ becomes a story of fascinating
vividness which thrills the reader and amuses him. The volume is no less enthralling
than ‘Two Years before the Mast,’ and higher praise can not be
accorded to a story of the sea.... A book of such extraordinary merit as
seldom comes to hand.”—<i>Philadelphia Press.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Warman holds a unique position among our tellers of tales, since he
alone is a practical railroad man, who knows the work, and has done it, in all
its details.”—<i>New York Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p>“Plenty of close-range photographs, interior views, of the great Burlington
strike are to be found in Cy Warman’s book.”—<i>Philadelphia Times.</i></p>

<p>“It has the great virtue of being a plain story plainly told by one who
knows. Whatever other impression it may convey to the reader, it conveys
most strongly the impression of truth. And this plain truth, told in a plain
way, is a terrible thing. One can feel all the way through that half the tale—and
perhaps the worst half—is left untold, yet such as stands in print is
sufficient, and to the reader who cares for something more than the superficial
adventurous incident of the book it will not be without its instructive
influence.”—<i>Denver Republican.</i></p>

<p><span class="large"><b>The Story of the Railroad.</b></span></p>

<p><span class="large">Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</span></p>

<p>“Far more interesting than the average novel.... Mr. Warman’s
volume makes us hear and feel the rush of modern civilization. It gives us
also the human side of the picture—the struggles of the frontiersman and his
family, the dismay and cruel wrath of the retreating savage, the heroism of
the advance guard of the railway builders, and the cutthroat struggles of competing
lines. He does not deal greatly with statistics, but the figures he uses
help make up the stunning effect of gigantic enterprise. There is not a dull
page in the book.”—<i>New York Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>“Intensely interesting—a history that reads like a romance, and compared
with whose marvelous story indeed most modern romances will seem spiritless
and tame.”—<i>Charleston News and Courier.</i></p>

<p><span class="large">A Novel of Modern New York. 12mo. Cloth,
$1.50.</span></p>

<p>“To picture a scheming woman who is also attractive and
even lovable is not an easy task.... To have made such a
woman plausible and real in the midst of modern New York life
is what Miss Stuart has achieved in this novel. And the other
characters reach a similar reality. They are individuals and not
types, and, moreover, they are not literary echoes. For a writer
to manage this assortment of original characters with that cool
deliberation which keeps aloof from them, but remorselessly
pictures them, is a proof of literary insight and literary skill. It
takes work as well as talent. The people of the story are real,
plausible, modern creatures, with the fads and weaknesses of
to-day.”—<i>N. Y. Life.</i></p>

<p>“The strength of the book is its entertaining pictures of
human nature and its shrewd, incisive observations upon the
social problems, great and small, which present themselves in the
complex life of society in the metropolis. Those who are fond
of dry wit, a subtle humor, and what Emerson calls ‘a philosophy
of insight and not of tradition,’ will find ‘Averages’ a
novel to their taste.... There are interesting love episodes
and clever, original situations. An author capable of such work
is to be reckoned with. She has in her the root of the matter.”—<i>N Y.

<p>“David Harum deserves to be known by all good Americans;
he is one of them in boundless energy, in large-heartedness, in
shrewdness, and in humor.”—<i>The Critic, New York.</i></p>

<p>“We have in the character of David Harum a perfectly
clean and beautiful study, one of those true natures that every
one, man, woman, or child, is the better for knowing.”—<i>The
World, Cleveland.</i></p>

<p>“The book continues to be talked of increasingly. It seems
to grow in public favor, and this, after all, is the true test of
merit.”—<i>The Tribune, Chicago.</i></p>

<p>“A thoroughly interesting bit of fiction, with a well-defined
plot, a slender but easily followed ‘love’ interest, some bold and
finely sketched character drawing, and a perfect gold mine of
shrewd, dialectic philosophy.”—<i>The Call, San Francisco.</i></p>

<p>“The newsboys on the street can talk of ‘David Harum,’
but scarcely a week ago we heard an intelligent girl of fifteen, in
a house which entertains the best of the daily papers and the
weekly reviews, ask, ‘Who is Kipling?’”—<i>The Literary
World, Boston.</i></p>

<p>“A masterpiece of character painting. In David Harum,
the shrewd, whimsical, horse-trading country banker, the author
has depicted a type of character that is by no means new to fiction,
but nowhere else has it been so carefully, faithfully, and
realistically wrought out.”—<i>The Herald, Syracuse.</i></p>

<p>“We give Edward Noyes Westcott his true place in American
letters—placing him as a humorist next to Mark Twain, as
a master of dialect above Lowell, as a descriptive writer equal to
Bret Harte, and, on the whole, as a novelist on a par with the
best of those who live and have their being in the heart of hearts
of American readers. If the author is dead—lamentable fact—his
book will live.”—<i>Philadelphia Item.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>MY GUARDIAN.</i></b></p>

<p>“A story which will, from first to last, enlist the sympathies of the reader
by its simplicity of style and fresh, genuine feeling.... The author is <i>au fait</i> at the
delineation of character.”—<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>THE THREE MISS KINGS.</i></b></p>

<p>“An exceedingly strong novel. It is an Australian story, teeming with a certain
calmness of emotional power that finds expression in a continual outflow of living
thought and feeling.”—<i>Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>“The story is told with great brilliancy, the character and society sketching is very
charming, while delightful incidents and happy surprises abound. It is a tuple love
story, pure in tone, and of very high literary merit.”—<i>Chicago Herald.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>NOT ALL IN VAIN.</i></b></p>

<p>“A worthy companion to the best of the author’s former efforts, and in some
respects superior to any of them.”—<i>Detroit Free Press.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>A&#160;MARRIAGE CEREMONY.</i></b></p>

<p>“‘A Marriage Ceremony’ is highly original in conception, its action graceful
though rapid, and its characters sparkling with that life and sprightliness that have
made their author rank as a peer of delineators.”—<i>Baltimore American.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>A&#160;LITTLE MINX.</i></b></p>

<p>“A thoroughly charming novel, which is just the finest bit of work its author
has yet accomplished.”—<i>Baltimore American.</i></p>

<p>“Miss Montrésor has the skill in writing of Olive Schreiner and Miss Harraden,
added to the fullness of knowledge of life which is a chief factor in the success of
George Eliot and Mrs. Humphry Ward.... There is as much strength in this book
as in a dozen ordinary successful novels.”—<i>London Literary World.</i></p>

<p>“I commend it to all my readers who like a strong, cheerful, beautiful story. It
is one of the truly notable books of the season.”—<i>Cincinnati Commercial Tribune.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>FALSE COIN OR TRUE?</i> $1.25.</b></p>

<p>“One of the few true novels of the day.... It is powerful, and touched with a
delicate insight and strong impressions of life and character.... The author’s theme
is original, her treatment artistic, and the book is remarkable for its unflagging interest.”—<i>Philadelphia
Record.</i></p>

<p>“The tale never flags in interest, and once taken up will not be laid down until the

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>THE ONE WHO LOOKED ON.</i> $1.25.</b></p>

<p>“A tale quite unusual, entirely unlike any other, full of a strange power and
realism, and touched with a fine humor.”—<i>London World.</i></p>

<p>“One of the most remarkable and powerful of the year’s contributions, worthy to
stand with Ian Maclaren’s.”—<i>British Weekly.</i></p>

<p>“One of the rare books which can be read with great pleasure and recommended
without reservation. It is fresh, pure, sweet, and pathetic, with a pathos which is perfectly
wholesome.”—<i>St. Paul Globe.</i></p>

<p>“The story is an intensely human one, and it is delightfully told.... The author
shows a marvelous keenness in character analysis, and a marked ingenuity in the development
of her story.”—<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>INTO THE HIGHWAYS AND HEDGES.</i> $1.50.</b></p>

<p>“A touch of idealism, of nobility of thought and purpose, mingled with an air of
reality and well-chosen expression, are the most notable features of a book that has not
the ordinary defects of such qualities. With all its elevation of utterance and spirituality
of outlook and insight it is wonderfully free from overstrained or exaggerated
matter, and it has glimpses of humor. Most of the characters are vivid, yet there are
restraint and sobriety in their treatment, and almost all are carefully and consistently
evolved.”—<i>London Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“‘Into the Highways and Hedges’ is a book not of promise only, but of high
achievement. It is original, powerful, artistic, humorous. It places the author at a
bound in the rank of those artists to whom we look for the skillful presentation of strong
personal impressions of life and character.”—<i>London Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“The pure idealism of ‘Into the Highways and Hedges’ does much to redeem
modern fiction from the reproach it has brought upon itself.... The story is original,
and told with great refinement.”—<i>Philadelphia Public Ledger.</i></p>

<p>“A faithful and an entertaining portrayal of village and rural life in the West....
No one can read this collection of short stories without feeling that he is master
of the subject.”—<i>Chicago Journal.</i></p>

<p>“One of the most delightful books of short stories which have come to our notice in
a long time.”—<i>Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>“The historian of the plains has done nothing better than this group of Western
stories. Wayside courtships they are, but full of tender feeling and breathing a fine,
strong sentiment.”—<i>Louisville Times.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>JASON EDWARDS. An Average Man.</i></b></p>

<p>“The average man in the industrial ranks is presented in this story in as lifelike

years ago.... A story which will be read with absorbing interest by hundreds of
working men.”—<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>A&#160;MEMBER OF THE THIRD HOUSE. A
Story of Political Warfare.</i></b></p>

<p>“The work is, in brief, a keen and searching study of lobbies and lobbyists. At
least, it is the lobbies that furnish its motive. For the rest, the story is narrated with
much power, and the characters of Brennan the smart wire-puller, the millionaire Davis,
the reformer Tuttle, and Evelyn Ward are skillfully individualized.... Mr. Garland’s
people have this peculiar characteristic, that they have not had a literary world made
for them to live. They seem to move and act in the cold gray light of reality, and
in that trying light they are evidently human.”—<i>Chicago Record.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><b><i>A&#160;SPOIL OF OFFICE. A Story of the Modern

<p>“It awakens in the mind a tremendous admiration for an artist who could so find
his way through the mists of familiarity to an artistic haven.... In reading ‘A Spoil
of Office’ one feels a continuation of interest extending from the fictional into the actual,
with no break or divergence. And it seems to be only a question of waiting a day or
two ere one will run up against the characters in real life.”</p>

<p>“Maarten Maartens is one of the best novel writers of this or
any day.”—<i>Chicago Times-Herald.</i></p>

<p>“Maarten Maartens stands head and shoulders above the
average novelist of the day in intellectual subtlety and imaginative
power.”—<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>

<p><span class="large"><b>Her Memory.</b> With Photogravure Portrait.</span></p>

<p>“Maarten Maartens took us all by storm some time ago with
his fine story christened ‘God’s Fool.’ He established himself
at once in our affections as a unique creature who had something
to say and knew how to say it in the most fascinating way. He is
a serious story writer, who sprang into prominence when he first
put his pen to paper, and who has ever since kept his work up to
the standard of excellence which he raised in the beginning.”—<i>New
York Herald.</i></p>

<p><span class="large"><b>The Greater Glory.</b> A Story of High Life.</span></p>

<p>“It would take several columns to give any adequate idea of
the superb way in which the Dutch novelist has developed his
theme and wrought out one of the most impressive stories of the
period. It belongs to the small class of novels which one
can not afford to neglect.”—<i>San Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p><span class="large"><b>God’s Fool.</b></span></p>

<p>“Throughout there is an epigrammatic force which would
make palatable a less interesting story of human lives or one less
deftly told.”—<i>London Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p><span class="large"><b>Joost Avelingh.</b></span></p>

<p>“Aside from the masterly handling of the principal characters
and general interest in the story, the series of pictures of Dutch
life give the book a charm peculiarly its own.”—<i>New York
